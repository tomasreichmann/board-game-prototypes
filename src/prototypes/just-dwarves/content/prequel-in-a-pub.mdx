# Just Dwarves: In a Pub

Just Dwarves: In a Pub is a quick card game where players are trying to restore their dignity at a typical night in a dwarven pub.

Players hold 6 cards in their hand. Each card has two halves â€“ a golden half and a blue half. The goal of the game is to have all your cards facing the golden half up. Players take turns activating one of the 6 unique cards in their hand to turn, move or pass them to another player. When a player manages to turn all the cards facing the golden half up, they win.

## Setup

Create a deck of 6 unique cards facing the blue side up for each player. Make sure that one of the decks has a MOIST FART card instead of a BOOGIE DANCE card. Shuffle each deck individually, then let each player pick a deck so that they don't know who has the MOIST FART. The player that farted most recently takes the first turn.

## Player's turn

Player picks one card and activates it. Read out loud the description on the top of the card and do what it says. Some cards also require other players to do something. After all this is resolved, the player on your right takes it's turn.

Make sure to maintain the position of your cards unless the cards call to move them.

Whenever a player receives a card, they can place on any position in their hand.

## Goal

When a player manages to turn all the cards facing the golden half up, they win (even if it isn't their turn).
