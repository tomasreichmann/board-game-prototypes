# Pub Brawl

Pub Brawl is a quick card game where players are trying to come up on top during a pub fight.

The goal of the game is to have all your cards facing the golden half up. Players take turns activating one of the 5 cards in their hand. Each card has two halves golden half and blue half. Activating a card causes it to rotate from golden to blue or vice versa. On top of that, each card has it's own special effect. When a player manages to turn all the cards facing the golden half up, he wins.

## Setup

Create a deck of 5 unique cards facing the blue side up for each player. Make sure that one of the decks has a FART card instead of a CHARGE card. Shuffle each deck individually, then let each player pick a deck so that they don't know who has the FART. The player right of the one who shuffled takes the first turn.

## Player's turn

Player picks one card and activates it. Read out loud the description on the top of the card and do what it says. Then turn the card itself. Some cards require other players to do something. After all this is resolved, the player on your right takes it's turn.

## Goal

When a player manages to turn all the cards facing the golden half up, they win (even if it isn't their turn).
