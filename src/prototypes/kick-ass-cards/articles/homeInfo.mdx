### Kick Ass Cards is a tabletop game system to run narrative games. It is setting independent, focused on roleplay and building drama.

It is fast-paced without any complicated arithmetic (all values are whole numbers from 1 to 12, but usually 1-3).  
There is no dice rolling and minimal output randomness. Players draw Outcome cards and get to decide when they succeed and when they fumble. You can still use your pretty dice to mark progress.

The system supports all kinds of gameplay:

-   **Combat!** - e.g. melee, ranged, magic, ship to ship, space-ship, large-scale battles,
-   **Social encounters** - e.g. persuading someone to give you information or lying your way out of a fine,
-   **Drama** - e.g. dealing with stress, panic and moral questions,
-   **Stealth** - e.g. sneaking past guards and overcomming a locked door, hacking,
-   **Crafting** - e.g. smithing, alchemy, engineering, architecture,
-   **Piloting** - e.g. evading pursuit on a horse, flying through an asteroid field,
-   **Survival** - e.g. wading through a storm, tracking an animal, tending wounds

## General rules

-   The storyteller presents a story in which players can make decisions for one or more characters.
-   If a player attempts something that could reasonably fail, the storyteller may tell them to play an Outcome card.
-   Each player has their own deck of Outcome cards. At the beginning of the session, the deck is shuffled, and each player draws **three** cards from the top of the deck.
-   The Outcome deck consists of:
    -   **Success** (3x): The action succeeded (Effect +2).
    -   **Partial success** (3x): The action succeeded partially (Effect +1, or success with some complication).
    -   **Fumble** (4x): The action failed (Effect 0).
    -   **Chaos** (1x): Something else happened instead of the intended action.
    -   **Super** (1x): Activates a special action specific for each hero (Effect +3).

import effects from "../data/effects-en.csv";

-   If a player has only Fumble cards or at least 3 Fumble cards in their hand, they immediately announce it to the storyteller. This triggers a **Tragedy**.
The storyteller describes how the Tragedy severly hurt the player. E.g. Player gets unconscious, looses an eye, looses a precious object. 
-   If a player doesn't have any Outcome cards in their hand, they are defenseless, but can rest during their turn and draw cards until they have 3 cards in hand.
-   Non-player characters are represented by **Actor cards**, which the storyteller places in front of the players. These characters will take their action after the player's turn.
-   Some goals and threats may require multiple actions to resolve and are represented by **Counter cards**. For example, "Timed bomb" or "Breaking down a door." The storyteller places a die with the current Counter value on the card.
    -   Players can influence the Counter value with their actions. If the value reaches a predetermined value, it can trigger story events, an unwanted effect, or release a reward.
    -   Counters can also tick down or up each turn or round.

### Injuries

-   Injuries threaten to render the player character unconscious until someone resurrects them.
-   If a player has at least 2 Injury cards, they are Dazed, and their Success cards count as Partial success.
-   If a player gains a fourth Injury card, their character is unconscious and cannot perform further actions until someone resurrects them. The character also receives a Chaos card.
-   Injuries can be removed by specific cards or by a treatment action.

</List>

### Distress

-   Distress threatens to break the character's current will to continue fighting until they recover.
-   If a player has at least 3 Distress cards, they are Gripped by panic. Instead of playing cards from their hand, they play cards from the top of the deck.
-   If a player gains a fourth Distress card, their character is Overwhelmed by hopelessness, and they can decide in their turn whether to surrender or run to safety.
-   Hope can be restored by resting, encouraging ally actions, or indulging in their Vice.

## Stunts

Stunts are exceptions from rules that players can pick during character creation or character progression (e.g. after finishing an adventure campaign or a chapter).

## Encounters

An Encounter is a scene where players need overcome an obstacle or reach a specific goal.  
It can include:

-   **Actors** - non-player characters
-   **Clocks** - a progress tracker of effort required to fulfill a specific goal or tracks time in turns or rounds before something happens.
