### Kick Ass Cards is a tabletop game system to run narrative games. It is setting independent, focused on roleplay and engaging story.

It is fast-paced without any complicated arithmetic (all values are whole numbers from 1 to 12, but usually 1-3).  
There is no dice rolling and minimal output randomnes. Players draw Outcome cards and get to decide when they succeed and when they fumble. You can still use your pretty dice to mark progress.

The system supports all kinds of gameplay:

-   _Combat!_ - e.g. melee, ranged, magic, ship to ship, space-ship, large-scale battles,
-   **Social encounters** - e.g. persuading someone to give you information or lying your way out of a fine,
-   **Drama** - e.g. dealing with stress, panic and moral questions,
-   **Stealth** - e.g. sneaking past guards and overcomming a locked door, hacking,
-   **Crafting** - e.g. smithing, alchemy, engineering, architecture,
-   **Piloting** - e.g. evading pursuit on a horse, flying through an asteroid field,
-   **Survival** - e.g. wading through a storm, tracking an animal, tending wounds
