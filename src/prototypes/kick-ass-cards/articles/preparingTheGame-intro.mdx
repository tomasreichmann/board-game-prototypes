# Preparing the Game

Follow this guide to get everything ready for your game.

You will need at least these components:

-   **one deck of Outcome cards per player** - players use those to decide how successful they were in their actions.
-   **a couple blank Actor cards** - you will need these to represent the characters of your adventure both player and non-player ones.
-   **a couple blank Clock cards** - you will need these to represent both sustained effort towards goals and impending threats.
-   **a couple blank Asset cards** - you will need these to represent both sustained effort towards goals and impending threats.
-   **one sheet of the most common Effect cards per player** - you will need these to track player Wound and Distress cards as well as some conditions like Panic or Complication.

Nice to have components:

-   **prefilled Actor, Clock, Effect and Asset cards specific for your adventure** - this will make your game feel unique and give it a feel of high production value.
-   **dice** - you can put dice on the Clock and Actor cards to mark effort or wounds. Standard D&D D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 dice work best.
-   **battle maps** - printed maps or maps projected on a table make your combat encounters more tactical and make it easier for players to interact with the environment.
-   **minis** - these can represent your playable and non-playable characters on a battle map.
-   **boxes** - players can store their cards there between sessions.

## Recommended Tools

The game consists of a number of cards. You can use pen and paper and cut the cards with scisors as you go.
If you want to provide a more polished experience, there are a lot of ways you can polish your components and enhance the players' experience. Consider this especially for the Outcome cards. It is rather important that players don't know what card are they drawing next. Light 70g office paper is easy to see through.

### Printing cards

You can have your cards printed in a print shop on thicker paper. 250-300g paper works best.

If you consider printing cards at home, some printers work better than others:
-   In general, laser printers will provide better quality of print and faster printing times for higher upfront cost but better operating costs in the long run. Laser printed cards are more resistant to water damage and have a glossier surface.
-   Printers often offer multiple ways of inserting paper. Printers that print without bending the paper usually support thicker paper around 200g-300g.
-   Some printers allow double sided printing. But the precision of double sided printing varies from printer to printer. It is usual that your prints will be randomly shifted by a few mm or rotated by a few degrees.
-   Some people prefer printing both sides of the card on the same piece of paper and gluing them together, sometimes also adding a thick core or laminating them.

### Cutting cards

Some print shops also offer die cutting or laser cutting your cards. Die cutting can be quite expensive, if you need to have a custom die made. It may make more sense to ask what cutting dies they have on hand, or cut the cards at home.

If you want to cut cards at home, there are several options:
-   Cutting cards using a scalpel, metalic ruler on a cutting mat. Scalpel allows for quick precise cuts but requires a steady hand. Metalic ruler is more durable, so that you don't cut your ruler with the scalpel. Cutting mat helps to provide a safe hard surface to cut against, so that you don't bend and frey the edges while cutting on a soft surface.
-   You can invest in a special [die cutter](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/88-6-63-3mm-playing-card_1600912381031.html?spm=a2700.7724857.0.0.5c915ce3Hnsjd7) that cuts already rounded cards from a sheet of multiple cards.
-   There are many tools to cut corners on cards. The better ones allow cutting a whole stack of cards at once.
