            <H2 mt>What Makes Mighty Decks Unique?</H2>
            <Body mt>
                <strong>One Card System</strong> ‚Äì Everything is represented by cards, no pencil needed. This makes the
                game more balanced and gives players more control over when to succeed and when it's fun to fail.
            </Body>
            <Body mt>
                <strong>Setting-Neutral</strong> ‚Äì The game supports fantasy, sci-fi, historical, or completely
                improvised settings.
            </Body>
            <Body mt>
                <strong>Narrative-First</strong> ‚Äì The system supports action, social play, stealth, crafting, survival,
                moral conflict, and more ‚Äî all through collaborative storytelling.
            </Body>
            <Body mt>
                <strong>Minimal Prep, Maximum Action</strong> ‚Äì With just one deck per player and a handful of reference
                cards for conditions and counters, you can get a session running in minutes.
