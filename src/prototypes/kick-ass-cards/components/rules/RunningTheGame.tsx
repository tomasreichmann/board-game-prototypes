            + Mighty Decks is a system for interactive storytelling. The Storyteller creates the world, while the players bring it to life through their characters and choices. Together, you’ll weave a tale of adventure, intrigue, and excitement.

            Roleplaying
            + Each player assumes a role of a character in the story. Like a brave knight, cautious thief or cruel superhero.
            + They can pick some character traits and flaws.
            + When the Storyteller asks what their character does, they can describe what they are doing, or even act it out and speak from the first person perspective. This is not required, but may greatly enhance their immersion and experience.

                + There are many types of scenes. Scenes with high tention: Combat, Stealth, Social interaction, Difficult Moral Choices. And lower tension like Exploration, Travel, Investigation, Transition, Down-time.
                + Every scene should have a SOMETHING description. Introduction of environment, how players got there and why, who else is present.
                + Players can now react, ask questions and describe what their characters want to do.
                + If a player wants to do something risky, uncertain or dramatically important, the Storyteller asks the player to play a Outcome card from their hand. Like atacking, defending, convincing a stubborn NPC...
                
                Playing an Outcome Card
                + The player choses a card from their hand and plays it on the table. Depending on the card, the Storyteller interprets the result.

                    + The Storyteller explains what player actions move the counter up or down, or when does it tick up or down on it's own (e.g. every turn, every round). And gives players some idea what may happen when it reaches it's maximum or minimum.
