                Mighty Decks is designed for <strong>1–4 players and a Storyteller</strong>. Together, you’ll create
                gripping scenes, make bold choices, and face consequences shaped by clever card play, not chance. The
                game emphasizes storytelling, roleplay, and creative problem-solving, making it perfect for both new
                players and seasoned RPG groups.

            <Body mt>
                <strong>One Card System</strong> – Everything is represented by cards, no pencil needed. Using cards to
                decide success or failure makes the game more balanced and gives players more control over when to
                succeed and when it&apos;s fun to fail.

                <strong>Setting-Neutral</strong> – The game supports fantasy, sci-fi, historical, or completely
                improvised settings.
