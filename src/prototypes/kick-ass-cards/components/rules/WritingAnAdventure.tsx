            <H2 mt>What Makes Mighty Decks Unique?</H2>
            <Body mt>
                <strong>One Card System</strong> – Everything is represented by cards, no pencil needed. Using cards to decide success or failure makes the
                game more balanced and gives players more control over when to succeed and when it's fun to fail.
