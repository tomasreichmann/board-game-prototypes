Explain Effect

Some player tasks take more effort than a single action, for example "breaking a castle gate" requires 8 Effect. So players need to spend multiple actions with various Outcome cards to fulfill the task.

Super is tied to a specific special action of a player and can only be used when it makes sense, like "Awesome parkour" or "Experienced hacker". But when it's used, it has the highest effect of any Outcome card.

Chaos:
"Something new appeared",
"Threat changed",
"Things got shuffled",
"Personality shift",
"Unexpected emotions",
"Silly mishap"
