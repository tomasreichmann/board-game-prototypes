# Cold Revenge

<Heading imageUri="/LP/ScrattCZ_a_squad_of_sci-fi_heroes_heat_death_of_the_universe_hy_472c154b-c146-4e49-b43f-78288b4d7018.png" />

**RPG high sci-fi three-shot about revenge.**

_As a group of veterans in service of a clan of genetically modified women, you set off against the Spores - an interstellar weed that relentlessly consumes all living things. You have come for revenge, but the road to vengeance is treacherous. How far are you willing to go to protect what you hold most dear? How much of yourselves are you willing to sacrifice on this journey for retribution?_

## Character creation assumptions

-   Your crew are heroes, seasoned veterans of the rescue operation on the planet Sporefall. You rescued a group of researchers from the clan, but with them came a (player) character who was not originally part of your unit. You couldn't save everyone, and the planet succumbed to the Spores.
-   Engineer Viktor is traveling with you, trying to gain influence with the Clan but needing your help to do so.
-   Everyone is fiercely loyal to the Clan. Its existence is a matter of life and death for them.
-   The highest authority the group recognizes is Her, the Chief Representative of the Clan.

## Heroes

Each hero should be distinct. You can define these aspects:

-   **Name**
-   **Specialization** - e.g. mercenary, scientist, hacker, pilot.
-   **Equipment** - generally, what the character uses to solve problems. It can partially be spoils from Sporefall.
-   **Virtue** - a quality that helps the character overcome obstacles.
-   **Vice** - a quality that gets the character into trouble and increases stress.
-   **Injury** - an injury from the Sporefall mission that just won't heal.
-   **Special actions** - an action with increased Effect. e.g. "Bull's Eye - incredible accuracy when shooting their rifle."

## General rules of Kick Ass Cards

Kick Ass Cards is a tabletop game system to run narrative games. It is setting independent focused on roleplay and building drama.

-   The storyteller presents a story in which players can make decisions for one or more characters.
-   If a player attempts something that could reasonably fail, the storyteller may tell them to play an Outcome card.
-   Each player has their own deck of Outcome cards. At the beginning of the session, the deck is shuffled, and each player draws **three** cards from the top of the deck.
-   The Outcome cards are:
    -   **Success** (3x): The action succeeded (Effect +2).
    -   **Partial success** (3x): The action succeeded partially (Effect +1, or success with some complication).
    -   **Fumble** (4x): The action failed (Effect 0).
    -   **Chaos** (1x): Something else happened instead of the intended action.
    -   **Super** (1x): Activates a special action specific for each hero (Effect +3).

import outcomes from "../outcomes-en.csv";

<Hand
    className="h-[350px] max-w-[800px]"
    items={[
        <Outcome {...C.defaultAssetProps} {...outcomes[0]} />,
        <Outcome {...C.defaultAssetProps} {...outcomes[1]} />,
        <Outcome {...C.defaultAssetProps} {...outcomes[2]} />,
        <Outcome {...C.defaultAssetProps} {...outcomes[3]} />,
        <Outcome {...C.defaultAssetProps} {...outcomes[4]} />,
    ]}
/>

import effects from "../effects-en.csv";

-   If a player has only Fumble cards or at least 3 Fumble cards in their hand, they immediately announce it to the storyteller. This triggers a Tragedy. The storyteller describes how the Tragedy severly hurt the player. E.g. Player gets unconscious, looses an eye, looses a precious object.
-   If a player doesn't have any Outcome cards in their hand, they are defenseless, but can rest during their turn and draw cards until they have 3 cards in hand.
-   Non-player characters are represented by Actor cards, which the storyteller places in front of the players. These characters will take their action after the player's turn.
-   Some goals and threats may require multiple actions to resolve and are represented by Counter cards. For example, "Timed bomb" or "Breaking down a door." The storyteller places a die with the current Counter value on the card.
    -   Players can influence the Counter value with their actions. If the value reaches a predetermined value, it can trigger story events, an unwanted effect, or release a reward.
    -   Counters can also tick down or up each turn or round.

### Injuries

-   Injuries threaten to render the player character unconscious until someone resurrects them.
-   If a player has at least 2 Injury cards, they are Dazed, and their Success cards count as Partial success.
-   If a player gains a fourth Injury card, their character is unconscious and cannot perform further actions until someone resurrects them. The character also receives a Chaos card.
-   Injuries can be removed by specific cards or by a treatment action.

    <Effect {...C.defaultEffectProps} {...effects[3]} className={C.defaultEffectProps.className + " not-prose card-up card"} broadcastProps={{ hideControls: true }} />
</List>

### Distress

-   Distress threatens to break the character's current will to continue fighting until they recover.
-   If a player has at least 3 Distress cards, they are Gripped by panic. Instead of playing cards from their hand, they play cards from the top of the deck.
-   If a player gains a fourth Distress card, their character is Overwhelmed by hopelessness, and they can decide in their turn whether to surrender or run to safety.
-   Hope can be restored by resting, encouraging ally actions, or indulging in their Vice.

## Stunts

Stunts are exceptions from rules that players can pick during character creation or character progression (e.g. after finishing an adventure campaign or a chapter).

## Encounters

An Encounter is a scene where players need overcome an obstacle or reach a specific goal.  
It can include:

-   **Actors** - non-player characters
-   **Clocks** - a progress tracker of effort required to fulfill a specific goal or tracks time in turns or rounds before something happens.

## Mechanics specific to this story

This story is about a hostile and dying universe, in which players must maintain the correct operational temperature and decide whether they need to deploy extra effort, which can gradually turn them into a monster.

### Frost and Heat

-   Frost and Heat represent how far the character is from their operating temperature.
-   Various actions and events can cause the character to gain a Frost or Heat card.
-   Frost and Heat cards cancel each other out. Pairs of these cards can be discarded immediately.
-   If a character has two or more Heat cards at the end of the turn, they gain an Injury card.
-   If a character has two or more Frost cards at the end of the turn, they gain a Distress card.

    <Effect {...C.defaultEffectProps} {...effects[10]} className="not-prose card-up card" broadcastProps={{ hideControls: true }} />
</List>

### Doom

-   Doom is a measure of succumbing to dark thoughts and turning into a Monster.
-   If a player gains 3x Doom, the Hero transforms into a Monster, and Doom becomes Redemption, which works exactly the opposite.
-   Doom can only be reduced by a rare intervention of a powerful being.

## Character creation assumptions for this story

-   Your crew are heroes, seasoned veterans of the rescue operation on the planet Sporefall. You rescued a group of researchers from the clan, but with them came a (player) character who was not originally part of your unit. You couldn't save everyone, and the planet succumbed to the Spires.
-   Engineer Viktor is traveling with you, trying to gain influence with the Clan but needing your help to do so.
-   Everyone is fiercely loyal to the Clan. Its existence is a matter of life and death for them.
-   The highest authority the group recognizes is Her, the Chief Representative of the Clan.

# Sample characters

## Name: Holden Cantos

### Backstory
I was born in a small planet far away from civilization. Life to me was cruel and I lost my legs when was 8 years old because of hypothermia. Lately, I was sold to a famous crafter, who needed cheap hands for dirty work, so from him I got two upgrades: gravity crouches which allows me to move and float in few meters above the ground and brain implant that lowers my mental abilities, so I can’t be my masters rival.

Working as a journeyman in his workshop, I learned how work some primitive mechanisms and craft not complicated technology. (for example, I can build small robots or fix slight issues on a spaceship, but crafting a gun or repairing engine is too complicated)
When the Clan, during their assault on our planet, killed my master and robbed the workshop, I had to chose between death or serving to Her.

Specialization:  handyman
Equipment: I have a common mechanic toolset
Virtue: I collect all technology that I can find and try to learn it. Mostly it fails or explodes in my hands
Vice: People can be mean and think that I’m retarded because of my implant. So recently we’ve started finding our most annoying clan members with signs of lobotomy, we still haven’t found the criminal.
Injury: My gravity crutches do not allow me to act as a common man and sometimes needs recharging
Special actions: I can boost my crutches, so they start firing with plasma heating enemies around or bonding metals. Works shortly and only when I have fuel.
