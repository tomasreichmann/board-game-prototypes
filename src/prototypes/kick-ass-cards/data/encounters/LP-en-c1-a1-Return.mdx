# (Summary for GM: Mission to rescue the Clan Gynie research team on the planet Sporefall)

-   Clan Gynie is located in the Markanian 40 Dark Sphere in the ARP 151 system. Their goal is to ensure the longest possible future for their kind.
-   The RH4 crew was sent to the planet Sporefall, formerly known as Media, which is under attack by the Spores, an intergalactic parasite that consumes entire planets and turns their inhabitants into mindless drones.
-   It is very rare that a creature colonized by Spores retains its own consciousness. These Spore hybrids often prefer other hybrids and consider them their new family. They prefer worlds completely engulfed by Spores.
-   The crew was tasked with rescuing the Clan's research team, which they succeeded in doing. However, they also brought a Spore hybrid named Flora on board.
-   Dr. Almo Zimostráz (Buxus) is Flora's father, a biologist in the program to protect against Spores who locked her in quarantine with the Clan's researchers to protect her, but he succumbed to the Spores himself and became a hybrid. Bruxus tried to persuade the crew not to open the quarantine until sterilization was complete, but they didn't listen. This was because the Spores could destroy their ship. The crew overpowered Bruxus and opened the quarantine prematurely. As a result, Flora was infected with Spores, lost her memories of her father, and is condemned to a life of seclusion. Bruxus has nothing left but to seek revenge. The Gynies and their mercenaries are to blame for everything.

# Chapter 1 - Act 1 - Return

-   You are in your cabins on your RH4 ship. Some of you gaze into the endless stream of lights in the interstellar corridor. Someone has locked themselves in the hot air shower.
-   In the background, one of the monitors is playing a muted news channel stream with subtitles:
    -   A xenobiology expert explains:
        -   "We have very limited information about Spores and their spread."
        -   "The ability of these parasites to infect new planets is unprecedented and a threat to the entire known universe."
        -   "One of the few things we can say with relative certainty is that the infection manifests externally within minutes."
        -   Moderator: "So, would it be fair to say that within a few minutes of inhaling Spores, you're a goner?"
        -   Expert: "That's really an impertinent simplification."
        -   Moderator: "Uh, what?"
        -   Expert: "Stupid, Madam Moderator, stupid..."
-   Everyone plays scenes from the mission you just returned from in their heads. (This is important)
    -   You were in service to Clan Gynie and set out to a planet that nobody calls anything but Sporefall in the news anymore.
    -   The planet is under attack by Spores, an interstellar weed that consumes entire planets and turns their inhabitants into mindless drones.
    -   Your mission was to rescue a group of female researchers from the Clan. You found them, along with Flora, locked in quarantine in the lab of Dr. Zimostráz. The doctor tried to protect them from the Spores.
    -   He begged you not to open the quarantine until sterilization was complete. At that moment, a swarm of Spore drones, mutated colleagues of Dr. Zimostráz, attacked.

-   You had to act quickly, so you opened the quarantine, grabbed the researchers, and jumped into the ship with the drones on your tail.
    -   Only you, 5 Clan researchers, and Flora made it onto the ship.
    -   Meanwhile, Viktor, your tentacled ship engineer, managed to load valuable Clan equipment on board.

    -   On the way to the ship and during the flight into orbit, you witnessed how the Spores overgrow cities and convert all living things into more Spore plants. Images of such horror will be difficult to get out of your head.

-   Flora is a great source of comfort in introspection. When you're with her, everything seems okay, and the universe is as it should be. You feel like you've known her forever.

    -   Some of you may have been troubled by Xe's malfunction. He kept babbling about how Flora is a dangerous Spore hybrid who manipulated you into taking her aboard with her neuroactive pheromones. But when he saw that no one was reacting to it, he shrugged and calmed down.

-   Your RH4 ship is just leaving the interstellar corridor. You are preparing to land as planned on the New Vega station, where you will unload the Clan research team and perform repairs.

-   It's a neutral station in the middle of nowhere, where humanoids go to relax, celebrate, and spend their hard-earned credits.

### Arrival at the New Vega station

You dock at the New Vega station, and your crew and the Clan researchers are ready to disembark.

You are greeted by a droid: "Welcome, RH4 crew, to the New Vega station. Your accommodation at the One Season hotel is ready. I'd be happy to take your luggage there for you."

-   The research team loaded the robot with a pile of luggage, which it tirelessly transported to all the rooms.

#### Hotel room

-   You have settled in and refreshed yourself after a long journey, taking a shower with real water or enjoying the minibar.
-   The original RH4 crew members were informed that they should report to the conference room. It's certainly a planned debriefing with representatives from Clan Gynies.
-   You know it's not good to keep them waiting, so you head to the conference room on the same floor.
-   Flora hears the voices of the others in the hallway.

#### Debriefing

<Player url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyThZdq4SlA&ab_channel=WhiteBatAudio" controls height={100} />

-   You have gathered in the conference room.
-   The holographic communication is still loading, so you have a few minutes before the connection is established.
-   It's time to gather your thoughts and decide what to say:
    -   The mission was to rescue the Clan research team and retrieve valuable equipment.
    -   You were also supposed to prevent the spread of spores, both in the form of microbiological particles and infected drones, especially the mysterious spore hybrids, which are still a big unknown.
    -   Almost all of the planet's inhabitants have perished. The fate of Dr. Zimostráze, whom you left to the spore drones in an effort to save your own skin, seems clear.
    -   (Discussion - interrupt after a while)
-   You see the majestic figure of Ony, the highest authority of Clan Gynies, on the screen:

"Welcome, my heroes. I am overjoyed that you have managed to reach safety unharmed.
As I have been informed, the mission was successfully completed, and the research team is safely on the station.
In addition, you have brought valuable equipment - an energy cell, a drone swarm, and weapon systems.
The Clan thanks you for your bravery.
Nevertheless, please kindly summarize how the rescue operation went."
