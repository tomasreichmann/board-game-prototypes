-   You have met up at the hotel bar.
-   You see a group of researchers sitting at the bar. They still look quite traumatized. And a little further away, Viktor.

-   Viktor came to you and brought drinks - all at once: the ice in them has already melted.
-   Viktor installed the drone swarm and weapon systems that you captured at Sporefall on your ship, while Ona requested to send the energy cell to the Clan.
-   Viktor added some extra trinkets to everyone to make them happy:
    -   A deck of playing cards with automatic shuffling.
    -   A weapon module that allows customizing weapon sounds, such as sound signals before the last bullet is fired from the magazine.
    -   Stickers with the face of a crew member, so they won't eat their snacks from the fridge.
    -   Glasses with a rear camera.
    -   Heated waterproof socks with a massage module.
    -   A sticker that can be used to track the position via a communicator.
-   Viktor complains that the Clan ignores him and does not appreciate his participation. It seems that the researchers are not talking to him.

## The night is still young

-   You notice that many people are getting up and leaving.
    -   A party is starting at the local Club at the End of the World, which the regulars are very excited about.

-   What do you do? (2 action rounds)

# Uninvited guests

-   (While the crew is having fun, a ship covered in spores lands on the station)
-   (Most of the tourists freak out and leave)
-   (Security cameras capture a scene where the local security tries to detain the spore drones, but they wipe the floor with them and turn them into more spore drones)

## End of the party

-   **The music stops**
-   A swarm of spore drones burst into the room!
