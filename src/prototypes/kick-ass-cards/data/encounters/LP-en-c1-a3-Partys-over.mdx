# Chapter 1 - Act 3 - Party's over

-   A loud bang like a cannon shot echoes through the room. The security window on the street shatters into a million pieces, and a frail figure enters through the opening.
    -   The music stops
    -   The guests gather around the figure, but quickly step back.
    -   The android rises from the ground. Its torso covered in vines and flowers.

-   More locals covered in vines burst into the club through the window. The crowd outside seems never-ending.
-   Panic sets in among the guests, and they start running towards the exit, creating a bottleneck.
-   A group of local security officers opens fire on the drones with plasma pistols, but the drones' extraordinary strength and mindless attack quickly overwhelm the security officers despite their firepower.
-   What's more, the bodies of the fallen officers become covered in moss after a while, and with a disturbing twitch, they join the ranks of the rampaging and ever-growing spore swarm.

**What do you do?** (1 action round)

-   You see a familiar face in the middle of the spore swarm. Dr. Zimostraz. But not quite. Vines sprout from his skin, and his shoulders are adorned with a mane of colorful spore flowers.
-   Suddenly, the spore drone swarm stops, and a familiar face emerges from the depths of the floral zombie horde. Dr. Zimostraz, but not quite.

-   His body is deformed by the spore infection, but unlike the other drones, you see a glimmer of intention, character, perhaps remnants of a soul in his eyes.
-   But that's impossible, the last time you saw him, he was left at the mercy of the spore drones.
-   In that moment, he spoke:

    -   "You're not really hard to find. Just follow the disgusting stench of guilt and the trail of destruction in your wake."
    -   "My home had a name before you left it in ruins. (Nedus 4)"
    -   "The Clan could have sent their fleet, but they were content with saving their few researchers."
    -   "How do you sleep at night, knowing how many lives you could have saved on your ship?"
    -   "Everyone I ever knew is gone, yet their empty expressions are with me forever. Until the devil takes my soul."
    -   "But until then, until my last breath, I will remain loyal to the Gynies, just as they were to me."
    -   "By the way, your mechanic got himself into trouble in the airlock. I could have helped him, but that wasn't my order. I only destroy and transform everything into new spores."
    -   He turns a tablet towards you: On the security camera stream, you see Viktor desperately banging on the airlock door.
    -   "So, what's it going to be? Are we going to fight, or are you going to run to save your lackey?"

**What do you do?**

## Fight

### Club

-   Decision: You see Opa preparing to use the gap between the drones and head for the exit. A massive but helpless Insectoid stands in her way, holding onto her cloak. A tentacle is starting to sprout from his eye. Amid screams of pain, he pleads with her for help and refuses to let go.
    -   (Opa will die if the player does not help her)
-   Decision: The fire suppression system on the ceiling could slow down the spread of spores in the air, but the temperature in the room will drop dramatically.
    -   Activation of the fire suppression system: Everyone in the club receives +1&nbsp;Frost every round. But the locals will not be at risk of spore infection.
-   Decision: Civilians are crowded in a narrow corridor, stepping on each other and completely filling it.
    -   Option: Throw fleeing civilians out of the corridor and expose them to spores (+1&nbsp;Doom)
    -   Option: Look for a way around and expose yourself to drones (Drone attack)
    -   Option: Blow up a wall (+1&nbsp;Doom)
-   Decision: An android, to which

### Bar

-   Decision: Several club employees with automatic rifles are standing behind the bar, aimed at the passage. The first spore drones are getting into the passage behind you. The employees are preparing to open fire.
    -   Option: Try to protect the escaping guests. (+1&nbsp;Injury to anyone trying to pass through the passage)
    -   Option: Intimidate the employees (Effect 2: -, Effect 1: Complication, Effect 0: +1&nbsp;Injury)
-   Decision: Ela is lying on the ground with a broken leg.
    -   Option: You can pick her up. (+1&nbsp;Hindered while carrying her)

### Street

-   Temperature: 0
-   Decision: Escaping guests try to get into parked cars and escape.
    -   Option: Break into the first available car
    -   Option: Run on foot
    -   Option: Convince someone to take you in
-   Decision: You see Una trying to throw an intoxicated Fungal out of his car after he refused to take her aboard.
-   Decision: Isa is trying to hack the security terminal of the door behind you. There are still enough guests in the club, but a swarm of spore drones is approaching the exit of the building.

-   Above your head, you see a large space ship covered in vegetation. Clumps of moss, leaves, and tangles of roots fall from it and wrap around everything in their path.

-   Evaluation of the "Delay" threat:

    -   Unfulfilled: You see Victor from a distance banging on the airlock window. The control panel flashes red. There is a hiss. The sudden drop in pressure propels Victor into space. He immediately loses consciousness and his lifeless body is surrounded by pink tentacles.
        -   Victor is in critical condition and unconscious. If you get him to the ship's infirmary, he might still recover.
    -   Fulfilled: From a distance, you can already see that the airlock is threateningly flashing red. Looking out of the airlock window, you see Victor's lifeless body surrounded by motionless pink tentacles in the emptiness of space.
        -   Victor cannot be saved anymore.
