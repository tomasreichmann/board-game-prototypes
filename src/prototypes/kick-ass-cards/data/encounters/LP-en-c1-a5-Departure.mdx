# Chapter 1 - Act 5 - Departure

<Player url="https://youtu.be/Vb-jZDiGrDo?t=0" controls height={100} />

-   You are at the cargo airlock
-   (We continue to monitor the **Saving New Vega** threat)

## Crowd at the entrance

-   From a distance, you can see a crowd of people trying to get to the airlock to board their ship. However, the capacity of the airlock is limited and the atmosphere is tense.

-   Security robots are scanning the incoming people.
    -   You see a cyborg approaching them, holding onto his eye.
    -   When scanned, the robots triggered an alarm. And immediately turned their flamethrowers and disintegrators towards him.
    -   Within moments, there was nothing left of the cyborg but a pile of ashes.
    -   The robots immediately called for the next person to be scanned.

## Departure Queue

-   The local security personnel are trying to maintain order and navigate ships to the airlock one by one.
-   There is a dismounted plasma tower here.
    -   Theoretically, it can be connected to an Android and fired once or twice with +2 Effect, but it will cause significant difficulties +3 Stress + Difficulty until recharged.
-   There is a large queue in front of you.

### Rodent Ship

-   A group of rodents are waiting impatiently as their ship docks.
-   A group of refugees of various origins are trying to sneak onto their ship. The rodents are trying to talk them out of it, but it is delaying their departure.
    -   (The Rodent ship has a different atmosphere than the station, which could poison some. The stench is noticeable when the airlock opens)
-   The rodents claim that they are missing a member who is still standing in line in front of the security checkpoint before the hangar.
-   (If they do not agree, the security personnel will use a security command and sever the ship -> +1 Panic)

### Insectoid Ship

-   Several insectoids and their cargo are next in line to board.
-   During quick loading, a warning appears that cargo inspection is required.
    -   The insectoids argue that there is no time for that.
    -   (The insectoids are smuggling a captured spore drone for research, but do not want to admit it)
    -   (The spore drone may escape from its container during the argument and attack refugees before the security team shoots it -> +1 Panic)

### Clan Representatives

-   We have received permission to evacuate you and the Gynies Clan researcher as a priority.
    -   (If the players decide to use this option, there will be unrest among the refugees +1 Panic)

### Panic

-   If there is panic among the refugees, one humanoid refugee pulls out an unsecured fragmentation grenade and threatens to detonate it if their ship is not next in line.

### RH4 Departure

-   Finally, it's your turn to board.
-   The crowd sees that you have a spacious and well-equipped ship.
-   Some refugees start bribing you to let them on board: Medi-gel, Nano-gel, Rapid-regen

## Leaving the Station

-   Your ship is ready to depart.
-   On the distant sensors, you see a spore ship heading straight for the home blacksphere of the Gynies Clan.
-   (Evaluation of the **Doom of New Vega** threat)
