# Chapter 2 - Act 1 - Departure

-   Your ship is ready to depart.
-   Take your stations
    -   For example: navigation, weapons, drone swarm, sensors and shields, reactor and propulsion, medic
    -   What station do you want to control?
-   You won't have to wait long for a message from Ona: "Prevent the infected ship from reaching the blacksphere of the Clan at all costs."
-   Sensors show that the spore ship is heading towards the interstellar gate.
-   The interstellar corridor is open, strange... you would say that the Clan has enough power to close the corridor in exceptional cases.
    -   (The interstellar gate is covered in spores, which keep the corridor to the blacksphere of the Clan open)

## Overclocking

There are many ways to gain extra strength and armor yourself in case of emergency on the ship, called _overclocking_. However, it is a dangerous process that always leaves some permanent consequences. It can be, for example, experimental stimulants, linking the ship's artificial intelligence with the brain, or overloading the voltage of energy implants from the ship's core.

## Doom

Various player actions, such as killing civilians, ruthless use of technology/bio-chemistry/weapons, can cause the character to receive +1&nbsp;Doom.

-   If the player reaches 2/4 Doom, they receive a secret message that hints at the doom that awaits them - First degree of Doom.
    -   **Techno-Doom:** The character loses emotions and is controlled more by programs than the words of others. They blindly pursue their goal and stop caring about the lives of others, including their own team.
    -   **Psycho-Doom:** The character loses their mind and decides to maximize their emotions, good or bad, regardless of the mission.
    -   **Spore-Doom:** The character becomes a spore hybrid. Spores fascinate them and they actively want to spread them. Parts of the body are replaced by spore tissue.
    -   **Hateful Doom:** The character is consumed by disgust, easily provoked, constantly cursing, attacking others, and opposing anything they can.
    -   **Destructive Doom:** The character is consumed by anger. They expose themselves to danger and do damage wherever they go. Their body becomes stronger on one side, but gradually falls apart.
-   If they reach 3/4 Doom, they receive the second degree of Doom.
-   If they reach 4/4 Doom, they receive the third degree of Doom.
    -   The player succumbs to their demons and becomes a monster.
    -   Any action that goes against their new belief requires extra success just to attempt it.
    -   They lose all Doom and instead gain Salvation 0/3.
        -   Acts where they sacrifice themselves for others, save the innocent, or successfully resist their demons give them one Salvation.
        -   If the character reaches Salvation 3/3, they are redeemed, lose all degrees of Doom, and their Salvation turns back into Doom 0/4.

### Interstellar portal passage

-   You see that the ring is covered in spore fungus. That must be the reason why the corridor could not be closed.
-   You see the safety systems of the ring activate. Ship systems warn that you have been targeted.

## Ship battle (GM info)

-   The turn alternates between the player and the Sp칩r.
-   Three spore tentacles grow from the ship.
    -   Tentacles can throw containers from the open cargo area.
    -   Tentacles can deflect the ship if it is at a distance of 0/6.
    -   Tentacles can defend the ship against the most dangerous attacks and let themselves be destroyed instead.
-   Players can defend against attacks if it makes sense within their station.
-   (We are monitoring the integrity of the RH4 ship, the integrity of the spore ship, and the distance between the ships.)

### Player actions

-   Approach the spore ship (e.g. piloting, reactor power, engine optimization, energy transfer from other systems, spore ship sabotage)
-   Damage the spore ship, for example:
    -   shooting (only at distance 2-4),
    -   drone swarm (only at distance 2-0),
    -   hacking,
    -   ramming (distance 1-0)
-   Repair your own ship (e.g. engineering, drone swarm)
-   Landing (only at distance 0)
-   Medic - portable medical station - player treatment (-1&nbsp;Injury / -1&nbsp;Distress)
-   Overclock - the ability to increase efficiency in exchange for Doom (Effect Overclock body / Overclock mind), for example:
    -   Direct connection of your body to the ship's systems
    -   Overclocking your implants
    -   Consumption of dangerous stimulants

### Spore Actions

-   In the first round, interstellar portal security systems attack the ship twice:
    -   Firing a rocket salvo (threat of 4 rockets). The rockets will impact in 2 rounds (rockets can be destroyed before impact).
    -   EMP cannon: A hit disables the player's station (Effect Disabled Station); +1&nbsp;Distress.
-   In the following rounds, the spore ship attacks:
    -   Throwing containers from the tentacle hangar (efficiency depends on the number of tentacles):
        -   Container with freezing mixture (-1&nbsp;Temperature to all)
        -   Explosive container (1&nbsp;damage to the ship)
        -   Stasis container with a captive (+1&nbsp;Distress to all if destroyed)
    -   EMP cannon: A hit disables the player's station (Effect Disabled Station); +1&nbsp;Distress.
    -   Plasma cannon - common injury.
-   Increase the distance by delaying RH4.

### Passage through the Ring

![](/LP/ship_in_hyperspace.jpg)

## Destruction of RH4 Ship

-   If the integrity of RH4 drops to 0, the ship will start to disintegrate.
-   Rescue modules can shoot the crew, but they get caught by tentacles or a force field and are directed to the hangar.
-   All characters can defend themselves against injuries when leaving the ship, they are at risk of up to 2 injuries.
-   If there are NPC characters on the ship, players can choose which 2 NPCs they want to rescue.

## Destruction of the Spore Ship

-   There were several explosions, the ship slowed down, and now it is flying lifelessly through the corridor towards its planned end.
-   The systems indicate that several rescue modules are leaving the ship.
-   Rescue modules:
    -   Stasis module with a woman inside:
        -   (The woman is Fatima Zimostr치zov치, the wife of Doctor Alma Zimostr치ze and the mother of Flora.)
        -   A pendant around her neck will display a hologram of the family portrait of Flora, Alma, and Fatima when pressed.
        -   Analysis of the module reveals that the woman is barely alive, as she is missing the lower half of her body.
        -   If an attempt is made to revive the woman, she will live for about a minute before collapsing and dying irreversibly.
            -   Fatima immediately recognizes her daughter Flora, even though Flora does not remember her.
            -   Fatima can answer three questions about Alma's research on spores, the spore attack on Sporefall, and Flora.
    -   Buxus, who will do everything to destroy the crew and infect them with spores, whoever he can.
    -   Singular warhead set to explode in 15 minutes. Upon explosion, a small black hole will be created, which will swallow everything within a radius of 1 km and disappear.
    -   Doctor Johanes King:
        -   Top doctor who can save Victor

**TODO: Characters and threats?**

## Landing

-   If RH4 is at a distance of 0, players can perform a landing and take over the spore ship either through an open hangar or through an airlock in the side section.
-   Each player can bring 1 NPC with them.
