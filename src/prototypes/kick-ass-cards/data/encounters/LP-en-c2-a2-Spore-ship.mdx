# Chapter 2 - Act 2 - Spore Ship

<Player url="https://youtu.be/-JFCwxVhHl0?t=8" controls height={100} />

-   The RH4 crew has boarded the Spore ship, which is rapidly approaching the home Black Sphere of the Gynies Clan.
-   There is not much time left before the ship leaves the interstellar corridor and reaches within range of the Clan - Threat of leaving the interstellar corridor.
-   If the Spore threat can be averted by then and the Clan convinced, the crew can save their own lives and those of the Clan.
-   We continue to monitor the threat to the Integrity of the Spore ship.

## Exterior

![](/LP/spore_bush.jpg)

You can see that the entire ship is covered in clusters of spore bushes. Just one spore is enough to infect an entire planet.

![](/LP/maps/overgrown_spaceship_interior.jpg)

The hangar doors are still wide open.

## Hangar

-   The hangar is a huge room where personal ships and fighters can land, and cargo can be unloaded and stored.
-   The hangar doors are still open and the room is without pressure and atmosphere.
-   There are several containers left:
    -   Container with explosives: Gluenade, EMP grenade, 2x Frag grenade
    -   Container with cooling mixture: Can make 3x Frost grenade
    -   Container with frozen creature: Vulcan Dragon - a lizard the size of a horse that breathes fire.
        -   (not aggressive, but not intelligent and requires a Success to execute even simple commands, otherwise it may interpret them its own way)
-   There are security doors leading to the hallway from here.
-   The first aid kit is on fire
    -   There are 2x Anxiolytics in it
    -   +1 Heat, if not extinguished before opening.

## Corridor

-   There are several doors leading from the corridor:
    -   Security doors to the hangar
    -   Door to the crew cabin
    -   Door to the mess hall where there is noise, like during lunch break.
    -   Door to the captain's cabin is covered with red spore bushes.
        -   The spore bush emits heat. Each time a character hits it up close, they get +1 Heat.
-   Cooling liquid leaks from a cracked pipe in the ceiling. It evaporates and sticks to the ground like a blue dense icy fog.
    -   Characters who step into the liquid get +1 Cold.
    -   (On the floor, there are **two massive green vines that attack when someone enters the fog or causes vibrations**, such as attacking the Spore Bush)

## Captain's cabin

-   A cryogenic module is connected to electricity on the wall. Through the frozen window, there is a bust of a woman with curly brown-gray hair and a pendant around her neck.

    -   (The woman is Fatima Zimostráze, the wife of Dr. Alma Zimostráze and mother of Flora.)
    -   The pendant, when pressed, displays a hologram of a family portrait of Flora, Alma, and Fatima.
    -   Analysis of the module reveals that the woman is barely alive, missing the lower half of her body.
    -   If an attempt is made to revive the woman, she will live for about a minute before collapsing and dying irreversibly.
        -   Fatima immediately recognizes her daughter Flora, even though Flora doesn't remember her at all.
        -   Fatima can answer three questions about Alma's research on spores, the Sporefall spore attack, and Flora.
    -   If Fatima dies and Flora realizes she is her mother, Flora gains 2x Doom.

-   Dr. Zimostráze's notes
    -   The doctor's notes first focus on a spore infection that occurred on his home planet of Nedus 4, later renamed Sporefall by the media.
    -   There is a record of the arrival of the Clan research team, who were interested in how spores can survive in the icy cosmos.
    -   The doctor retrospectively described how the spore infection suddenly spread. The Gynies Clan quarantined the planet and prevented anyone from leaving.
    -   In an attempt to save his family, the doctor locked the Clan researchers together with his daughter in the quarantine and sent an SOS to the Clan.
    -   The notes become increasingly emotional and critical, especially towards the Clan and the RH4 team they sent there.
    -   Towards the end of the notes, the doctor tries to slow the progress of his spore infection and comes up with increasingly nonsensical ideas to save his wife, whom he locked in a critical condition in the cryogenic module after the spore attack.
    -   The rest of the notes are just an incoherent stream of thoughts interspersed with a compulsion to spread spores wherever possible.
    -   You see Dr. Zimostráze's signature crossed out many times. The last page looks like someone was practicing the signature "Buxus."

![](/LP/crew_quarters.jpg)

## Crew cabin

-   The door to the cabin is barricaded from the other side.
-   Two children from Sporefall are hiding in the cabin. They don't want to open the door because they're afraid Buxus will eat them.
    -   The boy and the girl are spore hybrids. Whenever a flower grows somewhere on their body, they eat it so that no one can see it.
    -   The children don't remember their names, but they mask it with distrust.
    -   If something harms the children, they release a cloud of spores that causes +1 Doom to everyone in the area.
    -   The children locked the door to the infirmary. They say there's a ghost in there.

## Infirmary

-   The infirmary is well-equipped to treat even serious injuries.
    -   There are medicines: 3x Medigel, Rapid-regen, Rage
    -   The body of an insectoid in a pilot's uniform lies on one of the beds.
        -   He has 3x Anxiolytics, SPED with him.
        -   After examining him, it can be seen that three injections are sticking out of his back.
-   The infirmary was equipped with a state-of-the-art medical hologram. - The hologram system, located in the console in the infirmary, is infected with a spore infection. - The hologram is trying to take out the crew and spread the spore infection. - The hologram is not visible and can only be detected by monitoring the ship's cyber systems. - After opening the door, the hologram can move anywhere on the ship but cannot open doors. - The ability of the hologram to pick up objects can be prevented by destroying the holographic projectors in each room. - Every time someone is alone in the room, the hologram attacks them, for example, with an injection in the back causing Complications, Doom, or Injury. - An experienced engineer can remove the spore infection from the hologram. The hologram then serves as a doctor and can even revive Victor.

## Mess hall

-   The mess hall is full of spore drones.
-   The infected robotic chef is hiding in the spore crowd.
    -   Buxus ordered him to try to capture some NPC crew members and bring them to him as prisoners.
    -   The chef still cooks dishes, now with absolutely disgusting ingredients. (Pieces of human bodies, pus, hair, spores)

## Machine shop

-   The machine shop is dominated by the reactor, which is unnaturally humming and vibrating throughout the room.
    -   There are cracks in the reactor casing and radioactive fuel is leaking onto the floor.
    -   The radiation at the core is so high that even with a protective suit, it is likely to be a lethal dose for organics and synthetics (+1&nbsp;Doom).
-   The machine shop is overgrown with spore thorns, which are slowly expanding and engulfing all the equipment in the room.

![](/LP/drone_engineer.jpg)

-   The only silhouette slowly approaches you with jerky movements.
    -   If the crew attacks the engineer, the engineer will explode and injure the nearest crew member: +1&nbsp;Injury.
    -   (A synthetic engineer overrun by a spore infection is still fighting to control its shell).
        -   The engineer cannot move or speak properly. Only parts of sentences are understandable.
        -   The engineer knows all the ship's systems very well.
        -   Trying to save the engineer (Engineer rescue from Spore infection 0/6) exposes you to the risk of spore infection.
            -   Every action: Partial success - +1&nbsp;Injury, Fumble - +1&nbsp;Doom.
    -   The engineer is trying to prevent the core from collapsing, which would cause such a massive explosion that the ship would break into thousands of pieces flying at relativistic speeds in all directions. Who knows where the Spore infection would end up.
    -   Its joints are overgrown and it can't reach up to the core to fix the cracks.
-   3x Nano-gel can be found here.

## Bridge

<Player url="https://youtu.be/AzfSrJXMKZ4" controls height={100} />

![](/LP/buxus_final.jpg)

-   Despite the spore jungle, you can see Dr. Zimostráže in the cockpit, but he looks quite different from the last time you saw him. It seems that the spore infection is growing directly from him.
-   Buxus turned to you with outstretched arms and said:
    -   "Welcome! You have made me happy by coming to see me. I thought I would have to choose between wiping out the Klan or your pesky crew. I'm sure you've noticed that the surface of the ship is covered in spores. One explosion and the spores will spread in all directions. The ship will soon jump out of the interstellar tunnel right next to the Klan's Black Sphere. Boom!"
    -   "You took everything that mattered to me, now I'll do the same to you. This space charade has exceeded its lifespan. Let's end it."
    -   (If the heroes try to appeal to Buxus through Flora)
        -   Buxus forgot that his daughter became a victim of the spore infection.
        -   If the crew convinces him that she is really his daughter and not just a spore slave.
            -   Buxus will express regret, but explain that he cannot help spreading the spores.
            -   However, he will cancel the cockpit shield and order the spores to open the doors to the escape pods.
            -   Then roots will sprout from his eyes and skin until he becomes the spore-infected Buxus Monstrum.
-   Two Grappling Vines have emerged from the growth.
-   The ship's systems are overgrown with spore infection.
-   The cockpit is separated from the bridge by a force field, if the ship's systems are operational.
-   Along the walls of the bridge are 4 escape pods, each of which can hold 2 people.
    -   The pods are covered in spores, which need to be neutralized except for one, which has jammed doors.
    -   Pod A is empty - Buxus will escape in it if the ship is about to be destroyed.
    -   Pod B - A spore vine that holds a plasma torpedo. If the ship's core is stable, Buxus will use the torpedo for a suicidal destruction of the ship and dispersal of spores in all directions.
    -   Pod C - The pod is overgrown with spores and a dead insectoid is wedged inside, carrying 1x Medi-gel, 1x Rapid-regen, 1x Frag grenade.
    -   Pod D - Doctor King is barricaded inside.
-   Every dead NPC will become a spore drone.

![](/LP/spore_cockpit.jpg)

### Cockpit

-   The cockpit is protected by a portable force field that absorbs all energy damage if it is not turned off from the safety console overgrown with spores and protected by vines.
-   Buxus is navigating the spore ship directly into the center of the Klan's Black Sphere.
-   **(If Buxus is dying, he will destroy the navigation console with the autopilot set on a collision course with the Black Sphere. Then roots will sprout from his eyes and skin until he becomes the spore-infected Buxus Monstrum.)**

### Spore Action

-   Buxus (Dr. Zimostráže)
    -   Ship control: Change course, control doors
    -   Creation of Grappling Vine
    -   Mental spore attack: The character will attack another friendly character with their regular attack with 2x Effect reduced by their defense against spores.
    -   With each action, Buxus tries to sow discord among the crew:
        -   Buxus claims that it was the Klan researchers who caused the release of the spore infection from quarantine, because they needed a larger sample of the red bushes for research on generating heat from organic matter.
        -   Buxus appeals to all those infected with spores that the infection is irreversible and that they are going against each other when they try to save the Klan.
        -   Buxus appeals to NPCs to use the escape pods while they still have a chance.
-   Buxus Monstrum
    -   In the zone: Cloud of Ice Spores: +1 Weight, +1 Frost
    -   In sight: Throws bridge equipment +2 Injury
-   Grappling Vine
    -   Capture of a character - Stuck
    -   Blocking physical attacks on Buxus with the captured character
    -   Throwing a character onto another - +1 Injury to both
-   Spore Drones
    -   Bite: +1 Injury
    -   Capture: Stuck

## Leaving the Interstellar Corridor

-   When the threat of leaving the Interstellar Corridor is realized:
    -   The spore ship has left the corridor
    -   The screen shows the Klan black sphere
    -   Systems report that singular rockets are approaching - these rockets create a small black hole upon explosion that engulfs all matter within a range of several hundred kilometers.
-   (It is possible to convince Klan to deactivate the missile, but only if the spore ship is not heading towards the Klan black sphere.)

## Epilogue

-   If Buxus Monstrum is destroyed and the ship is either destroyed or not endangering the Klan black sphere, the game ends.
