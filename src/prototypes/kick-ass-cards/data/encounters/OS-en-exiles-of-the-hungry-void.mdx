# Exiles of the Hungry Void

*The Empire burns and the Void hungers for what is left.*

*Once, the Solarian Empire ruled a thousand suns under the undying light of the Absolute Sovereign. Now, the Emperor’s voice has gone silent, his heirs wage proxy wars in the dark, and the void itself hums with rebellion. The Solar Legion burns worlds in the name of order, the Technocratic League replaces faith with circuitry, and the Hemomancers twist flesh into new gods.*

*Yet among the drifting wrecks and shattered colonies, your crew dares to fly. A handful of outcasts, scavengers, and visionaries aboard a half-broken ship—fighting off raiders, patching ruptured hulls, rerouting power mid-battle, and diving into derelict stations that promise either death or unthinkable treasure. Against collapsing fleets and cosmic horrors, you’ll chart your own path through a dying galaxy.*

*What are you waiting for? Seal the hull breach and go charge the lasers!*

## Scene 1 – Dumped in the Void

### 💡 Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

-   The crew is being dumped on a space-ship in disrepair.
-   The players need to familiarize themselves with the ship, fix the systems and start exploring the Void.
-   This scene will teach them how to fix, power and man the ship's systems, chart the nearby points of interest, and start the spin engine to jump away.
-   During this, you need to forshadow the main antagonis the Shadow Horror by mentioning strange things happening throughout the ship and something unseen trying to get inside. E.g. frost gathering on windows, things moving on it's own, gravity anomalies, indistinct whispers, ship hull creaking.
-   When the ship is all but ready to jump away, the Shadow Horror appears in all it's might and attacks the ship. It must be clear the Shadow will destroy them easily, if they stay.

### Introduction

_They called it mercy._

_Whatever you did to deserve this, the Empire decided to exile you. You were loaded onto a rusting corvette and pushed toward the border of what the star charts call the **Hungry Void**._

_Once, the Void had been the Empire’s frontier—rich in minerals, strange worlds, and relics of civilizations older than history. Too many ships vanished. Colonies died without reason. So eventually, the Empire withdrew, sealed the gates, and left the region and it's survivors to their onw devices. Smugglers, pirates, and desperate souls like you now call this sorry place their own.

🎭 **Please introduce your characters**

You are on board a small retired military ship. It's original name has been scraped off. Once a proud corvette, now a gutted relic with half its systems stripped, the other half broken, and its hull holding together by sheer faith. The Imperial transport that brought you here didn’t linger. Its captain’s parting words still echo in the static:

> *“Cross back into the Empire space, and you’ll be shot on sight.”*

The transport jumps away in a blink of light, leaving you adrift at the edge of nothing.

As you gather on the bridge, you take stock of the ship:

-   *The reactor* is running on minimal power, supplying only enough power to feed the life-support.
-   *Life-support* is operational, but some rooms are unpressurized.
-   *The engines* are not responding and the spin drive needs to be charged before you can jump away.
-   All but one of the *weapon systems* were uninstalled. A single laser array is left and malfunctionning.
-   There is a *missile bay*, but there are no missiles.
-   The *crew quarters* has space for 8 people.
-   There should be some more rooms, but the corridor is sealed off.
-   Sensors need to be calibrated, befor you can survey nearby points of interest.
-   There is a *cargo bay* with a single box of food rations.

It's time to get to work.

🎭 **Who wants to start and tell me what you do?**

### Scene Information

-   The cyan-painted V on the attackers’ blacked-out tech-wear marks them as the Vanta Crew, a street gang known for arms smuggling and brutal tactics.
-   You’re perched on a rooftop several storeys above the alley. Below, piles of trash—mostly tossed produce from the nearby grocery store—rot under flickering light.
-   Light rain drums on the rooftop, water trickling down a gutter into a barrel at the corner.
-   Power cables sag between rooftops and flickering streetlights, humming faintly in the damp air.
-   🔎 Both cars have a full tank of fuel.
-   🔎 There are stale, but otherwise perfectly good sandwiches among the grocery store garbage.
-   🔎 The employees are frightened but may assist if convinced (e.g., one drives a forklift).
-   🔎 The crates contain brand new cordless drills and electric saws.
-   🔎 This is an initiation job of the new members of the Vanta Crew gang.
-   📅 If the heroes wait too long, the gang escalates the violence, beats up the employees, steals the cargo and leave.

Now you just gotta figure out how to sneak past your parents without catching a full-blown lecture._

## Scene 2 – The Test

### 💡 Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

* **Scene summary**: It's the morning after the rooftop brawl. The teens are bruised, exhausted, and completely unprepared for their physics test. To make things worse, Rebar is spotted near the school talking to two government agents. The agents meet with the physics teacher, hinting they’re looking for students who show signs of involvement in suspicious activity—especially anyone with poor grades or unexplained injuries.
* **Setting**: A chilly, fluorescent-lit classroom with buzzing lights and a worn-out whiteboard. The players are seated at separate desks, surrounded by students who are all furiously reviewing last-minute notes.
* **Threat**: The teacher is being pressured by the agents and is extra alert to cheating or suspicious behavior.
* **Objective**: Pass the test without being caught cheating or drawing attention. Avoid revealing signs of last night’s fight.
* **Exam mechanics**: Each player must answer 4 difficult physics questions. They can use stealth or social stunts to cheat (e.g., pass notes, sneak peeks, distract the teacher, or steal answer keys).
* **Tension builder**: If caught or acting suspicious, the teacher may report them to the agents.

*Your desk feels harder than usual and your eyelids heavier. The physics classroom smells faintly of whiteboard markers, cold coffee, and teenage panic. Rain streaks across the windows in blurry lines, and outside, a black sedan idles at the curb.*
*Through a crack in the classroom door, you notice your physics teacher, ms. Vogel, speaking with two grim-looking suits who definitely don’t teach here. You move to closer to listen in. All you can make out is that they are looking with kids with some unusual skills.*
*The agents told the teacher to let them know about any suspicious students especially if they have poor grades or unexplained injuries.*

*A moment later, you stare blankly at the test with four brutal physics questions. Your brain is fried from last night’s fight, and your powers are no help here.*
*Ms. Vogel paces through the class room looking for cheaters or worse...*

🎭 **The test starts now. What do you do?**

* Agent Renata Vales
* Agent Felix Brandt
