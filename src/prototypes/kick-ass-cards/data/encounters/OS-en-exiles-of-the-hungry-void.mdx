# Exiles of the Hungry Void

*The Empire burns and the Void hungers for what is left.*

*Once, the Solarian Empire ruled a thousand suns under the undying light of the Absolute Sovereign. Now, the Emperor‚Äôs voice has gone silent, his heirs wage proxy wars in the dark, and the Void itself hums with rebellion. The Solar Legion burns worlds in the name of order, the Technocratic League replaces faith with circuitry, and the Hemomancers twist flesh into new gods.  
But amid the floating wrecks and dying stars, your crew dares to fly‚Ä¶*

*A handful of outcasts, scavengers, and visionaries aboard a half-broken ship‚Äîfighting off raiders, patching ruptured hulls, rerouting power mid-battle, and diving into derelict stations that promise either death or unthinkable treasure. Against collapsing fleets and cosmic horrors, you‚Äôll chart your own path through a dying galaxy.*

*What are you waiting for? Seal the hull breach and go charge the lasers!*

## Scene 1 ‚Äì Dumped in the Void

### üí° Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

-   The crew is being dumped on a space-ship in disrepair.
-   The players need to familiarize themselves with the ship, fix the systems and start exploring the Void.
-   This scene will teach them how to fix, power and man the ship's systems, chart the nearby points of interest, and start the spin engine to jump away.
-   During this, you need to foreshadow the main antagonist the Shadow Horror by mentioning strange things happening throughout the ship and something unseen trying to get inside. E.g. frost gathering on windows, things moving on its own, gravity anomalies, indistinct whispers, ship hull creaking.
-   When the ship is all but ready to jump away, the Shadow Horror appears in all its might and attacks the ship. It must be clear the Shadow will destroy them easily, if they stay.

### Introduction

_They called it mercy._

_Whatever you did to deserve this, the Empire decided to exile you. You were loaded onto a rusting corvette and pushed toward the border of what the star charts call the **Hungry Void**._

_Once, the Void had been the Empire‚Äôs frontier‚Äîrich in minerals, strange worlds, and relics of civilizations older than history. Too many ships vanished. Colonies died without reason. So eventually, the Empire withdrew, sealed the gates, and left the region and its survivors to their own devices. Smugglers, pirates, and desperate souls like you now call this sorry place their own._

_An officer unceremoniously shoves you into a small shuttle. *"Cross back into the Empire space, and you‚Äôll be shot on sight." He spits out before slamming the shuttle door shut.* The autopilot engages and your shuttle silently exits out of the huge docking bay doors._

üé≠ **This is the first time you see one another. Tell us what the others see, when they look at you.**

_You reach a small retired military vessel and park in its docking bay. Once a proud corvette, now a gutted relic with half its systems stripped, the other half broken, its hull held together by sheer faith. Its original name has been scraped off._
_A blink of light illuminates the dark interior as the Imperial transport jumps away, leaving you adrift at the edge of nothing._

As you gather on the bridge, you take stock of the ship:

-   *The reactor* is running on minimal power, supplying only enough power to feed the life-support.
-   *Life-support* is operational, but some rooms are unpressurized.
-   *The engines* are not responding and the spin drive needs to be charged before you can jump away.
-   All but one of the *weapon systems* were uninstalled. A single laser array is left and malfunctioning.
-   There is a *missile bay*, but there are no missiles.
-   The *crew quarters* has space for 8 people.
-   There should be some more rooms, but the corridor is sealed off.
-   Sensors need to be calibrated, before you can survey nearby points of interest.
-   There is a *cargo bay* with a single box of food rations.

**It‚Äôs time to make this wreck fly**

üé≠ **Who wants to start and tell me what you do?**

### Scene Information

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/docking_bay.png)

-   **Docking bay**
    -   This is where you arrived.
    -   A small imperial shuttle sits in mostly empty dock. You could use it to board an enemy ship, if it's engines are disabled.
    -   üîé There is a box of rations, enough for now.
    -   üîé You noticed there is frost spreading on the outside door, but you cannot see anything outside.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/reactor.png)

-   **Reactor**
    -   Normally this is where the ship's power comes from. You can route it from here to different ship's system or even put it in overdrive and distribute some extra power.
    -   If fully operational:
        -   It should supply up to 3PU, but could be upgraded at specialized docks.
        -   You can put it in manual overdrive and supply up to 3 extra PU.
    -   It is running on minimal power, supplying just 1PU. All power is routed to life-support.
    -   üîé The fuel is almost gone and there does not seem to be any more. 
    -   üîé Looking inside the reactor is mesmerizing. You would have sworn you saw a dark shape in the reflection of its window behind you. There was nobody there.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/engine_room.png)

-   **Engines**
    -   They are un-powered. They need 1PU to provide thrust to move around and maneuver during fights.
    -   Even with these engines operational, you are so far from anything, it will take years before you reach anything worth the effort.
    -   Manning this station can provide extra speed.
    -   They can be upgraded to provide advantage over ships with weaker engines.
    -   üîé When the engines are running, they sometimes pick up a strange echo, like when flying through a magnetic field. But you are pretty far away from anything that can have one.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/spin_drive.png)

-   **Spin drive**
    -   üè∫ There is an Incendiary grenade strapped to the Spin drive ring. The safety pin is still in.
    -   It is un-powered. It needs 1PU for 5 turns, to get enough charge to jump to the next system.
    -   Manning this station can reduce spin-up time.
    -   üîé Its huge rings move almost imperceptibly slow on their own.
    -   üìÖ When spin drive starts to power up. Sensors register rising pressure on the outside of the hull without an apparent reason.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/weapons_station.png)

-   **Weapon station**
    -   You can fire the ship's weapons from here.
    -   All but one of the weapon systems were uninstalled. A single laser array is left, but it is malfunctioning.
    -   Manning this station can increase damage or fire rate.
    -   üìÖ As you investigated the malfunctioning laser, there was a buildup of energy from a damaged capacitor and the resulting spark ignited wiring hanging from the ceiling. The fire is quickly spreading.
    -   üîé If repaired, you can use it to target a specific room on the enemy ship. It causes 1 Damage to target system if not absorbed by shield in exchange for 1PU.
    -   üîé Repairing requires 1 Spare part.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/missile_bay.png)

-   **Missile bay**
    -   Deploying a missile requires someone to manually put the missile into the launcher, but does not cost any power.
    -   Missiles pass through shields, but cost ammunition.
    -   Manning this station is required for operation.
    -   üîé There are several parts lying around maybe enough to build a single missile.
    -   üîé Someone tried to stuff reactor fuel to a missile warhead. There is enough of it to run the reactor for a foreseeable future
    -   üìÖ Building a missile: As you were lowering one of the missile warheads from the crane, it suddenly released and the warhead fell from two meters and with a terrible clank hit the floor denting it deeply. It stopped rolling in front of your feet. Nothing happened.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/elevator.png)

-   **Sealed corridor**
    -   There is a sealed corridor. It looks like someone tried really hard to make sure nothing can enter or exit the corridor.
    -   üîé It looks like there are more rooms there, but unsealing would require hiring a specialized crew with some serious equipment.
    -   üîé You hear faint scratching from the other side.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/crew_quarters.png)

-   **Crew quarters**
    -   This room is closed off, because it is unpressurized. You cannot re-pressurize it from here.
    -   There is a room with enough cots to fit 8 people.
    -   üè∫ The dead person was holding onto 2 Synth-blood injectors (Healing x2)

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/life_support.png)

-   **Life support**
    -   Manning this station, you can re-pressure or de-pressure any room on the ship, control the temperature onboard and of the shower water, and reusing of waste water.
    -   üîé de-pressuring is useful in case of a fire or hostile boarding.
    -   üîé Water is not running at the moment. The water in the boiler seems to be frozen solid.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/cockpit.png)

-   **Cockpit**
    -   You can navigate the ship from here.
    -   üè∫ You can find a bottle of Imperial standard issue brandy (Comfort x2) - there's enough for 2 people to get nicely buzzed.
    -   üîé The orientation indicator must be broken, it is slowly spinning. You check the stars to make sure the ship is stationary.

![""](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/locations/sensor_array.png)

-   **Sensor array**
    -   üè∫ There are communicators for everyone here, you can easily communicate with each other, even between nearby vessels.
    -   üîé The sensors are un-powered, but in working condition. They require 1PU to operate.
    -   Manning this station you can survey space around you.
    -   üìÖ Powering up the sensors.
        -   You can survey nearby points of interest from here.
            -   üîé Doing so reveals 3 points of interest nearby. See *Points of Interest*
        -   You can survey enemy ships to find out what systems they have, so that you can target them.
            -   üîé There are no ships in the scanning range.
        -   You can search for life signs onboard the ship and setup alerts when you are boarded.
            -   üîé The life-sign detector is currently clearly malfunctioning. Life-signs are appearing and disappearing all over the ship. There doesn't appear to be anything physically wrong with it, though.

### üìÖ When the crew starts charging the Spin Drive

_The ship trembles as the Spin Drive begins to hum, a deep metallic vibration that crawls through the floor and into your bones. The lights flicker once, twice ‚Äî then turn into a dim red pulse. You notice the space outside the cockpit window begins to‚Ä¶ twist?! It doesn‚Äôt bend or move; it folds on top of itself, like a melted sheet of glass, straining‚Ä¶ until it snaps._

_A rift tears open to the Void. A darkness spills through, blacker than the space around it, tiny fake star-like lights glitter as they move unnaturally over the darkness. Twisting tendrils of shadow creep out, stretching larger than the ship itself forming into a terrifying entity._

_Every screen flares with static. Warning glyphs flicker and die. Metal groans in agony as the ship‚Äôs systems begin to fail ‚Äî not destroyed, but drained. The heat leaves the air. Frost creeps across consoles and bulkheads in seconds. You see your breath. Then, from somewhere deep in the hull, the sound of rending steel scratches your ear drums._

_The shadow tendrils are inside. They slither through cracks, and seams. Every surface they touch loses color, temperature, and light._

_The hum of the Spin Drive turns frantic, building toward an unstable crescendo. If it fails now, you are stranded._

üé≠ **The Void Horror has breached the ship. What do you do to protect the Spin drive and help it engage?**

üí° Add Counter: **Protect the Spin Drive** with a total 2x the amount of players.  
-   Have each player play one Outcome card and describe how they want to protect the Spin Drive.  
-   At the end of the round, distribute Injuries and damage ship systems for each point below the total of the Protect the Spin Drive Counter.
-   Then the **Spin drive engages**.

<CounterCard {...counterMap.defense} title="Protect the Spin Drive" current={6} total={6} reward="You jump away" threat="Ship systems damage, characters Injury" />

### Systems overview

-   *Reactor* ‚Äî power source, determines how many ship systems can be active
-   *Engines* ‚Äî provide thrust to move around and maneuver during fights
-   *Spin drive* ‚Äî jump to other systems
-   *Weapon systems* ‚Äî fire weapons
-   *Missile bay* ‚Äî deploy missiles
-   *Sensors* ‚Äî find other ships and their systems, plot course to points of interest
-   *Life support* ‚Äî control temperature and pressure
-   *Cockpit* ‚Äî navigation, communication

### üìÖ Spin drive engages

_The Spin Drive roars to life, its rings blurring into golden light as the ship lurches violently forward. With a sound like the universe tearing, the stars collapse into streaks‚Äîand in the instant before everything goes white, the shadow‚Äôs reaching tendrils vanish into nothing, left behind in the dying silence of the Void._

### üìÖ Next points of interest

The crew has to pick where to go next and jump there using the Spin drive.

-   *A transport in distress* ‚Äî A transport sent out a distress signal. It is being pursued by pirates.
-   *Abandoned research station* ‚Äî An abandoned imperial research station. Maybe there's still something of value that hasn't been looted.
-   *A mining colony has a pest problem* ‚Äî A nearby automated mining colony advertises a job to get rid of giant rodents nesting in its mining shafts.

### A transport in distress

-   You can jump to the transport in distress and rescue the crew.
