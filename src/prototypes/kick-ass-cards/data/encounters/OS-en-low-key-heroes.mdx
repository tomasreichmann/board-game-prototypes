## Scene 1 – Moonlight Brawl

### 💡 Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

-   **Scene summary:** The Vanta gang is initiating their members by having them steal a shipment of power-tools from a hardware store and harass their members.
-   There are 2 enemies per player. Armed with bats and guns. They should be easy to defeat.
-   Gun-wielding gang members may try taking a hostage.
-   Each hero starts with 3 uses of their powers.
-   A hidden senior gang member is there to observe and report to the gang.
-   Loud noise will raise suspicion and may compromise the secret identities of the heroes.

_The night air is sharp and cool, rooftops glitter with frost as you gather at the edge of a building overlooking a narrow alley. Below you, an SUV pulls into the alley and several people jump out waving baseball bats and guns in the air. It seems the gossip was true. Four hardware store employees are backed against a delivery truck, blinded by the car's headlights. Crates of power tools halfway unloaded are scattered around. Several gang members in black tech-wear bark orders, threatening the frightened employees._

🎭 **Your objective is to stop the robbery, protect the civilians, and defeat the Vanta gang members. At the moment, you are still hidden on a nearby rooftop. What is your plan?**

### Scene Information

-   The cyan painted V on the attackers blacked-out tech-wear mark them as the **Vanta Crew**, a street gang known for their DIY tech-goth aesthetic, and brutal practices.
-   🔎 The employees are frightened but may assist if convinced (e.g., one drives a forklift).
-   🔎 The crates contain brand new cordless drills and electric saws. One is marked with a customs seal—stolen from a larger smuggling operation.
-   🔎 Vanta Crew members wear blacked-out gear with carbon masks. Their symbol is a jagged “V” painted in glitchy white or faded neon.
-   🔎 This is an initiation job—new members of the Vanta Crew gang.
-   🔒 There is a hidden observing gang member **Rebar**, a veteran enforcer and recruiter. He reports to a secretive boss, he will not engage the players and leaves in secret whatever happens.
-   📅 If the heroes wait too long the gang escalates the violents, beats up the employees, steal the cargo and leave.

### 🏺 Rewards

-   🎁 **Saving the employees**: Each hero can later choose one item from the hardware store (e.g., crowbar, toolkit, power tools, metal parts).
