## Scene 1 – Moonlight Brawl

### 💡 Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

-   The Vanta gang is initiating their members by having them steal a shipment of power-tools from a hardware store and intimidate the store staff.
-   There are 2 weak enemies per player. Armed with bats and guns. They should be easy to defeat.
-   Gun-wielding gang members may try taking a hostage.
-   Each hero starts the scene with 3 uses of their powers. Track this with a die or custom tokens. Heroes can spend their superpower on any action, getting +2 effect. They can use their environment to recharge their powers.
-   Loud and reckless actions will count down the **Police Alert** counter. When it reaches zero the police shows up early triggering the **Resolution**.
-   Defeating or intimidating a gang member will count down the **Gang's Will to Fight** counter. When it reaches zero, the rest of the gang will run away. Some of them may run for the car and try to leave in it.
-   There is a hidden observing gang member **Rebar**, a veteran enforcer and recruiter. He reports to a secretive boss, he will not engage the players and leaves in secret whatever happens.

_The night air is sharp and cool, rooftops glitter with frost as you gather at the edge of a building overlooking a narrow alley. Below you, a matte-black SUV screeches into the alley and several people jump out waving baseball bats and guns in the air. It seems the gossip was true. Four hardware store employees are backed against a delivery truck, blinded by the car's headlights. Half-unloaded crates are strewn across the pavement, tools glinting under the flickering light. Several gang members in black tech-wear bark orders, threatening the frightened employees._

🎭 **The gang hasn’t seen you—yet. The employees are in danger. What’s your move?**

### Scene Information

-   The cyan-painted V on the attackers’ blacked-out tech-wear marks them as the Vanta Crew, a street gang known for arms smuggling and brutal tactics.
-   You’re perched on a rooftop several storeys above the alley. Below, piles of trash—mostly tossed produce from the nearby grocery store—rot under flickering light.
-   Light rain drums on the rooftop, water trickling down a gutter into a barrel at the corner.
-   Power cables sag between rooftops and flickering streetlights, humming faintly in the damp air.
-   🔎 Both cars have a full tank of fuel.
-   🔎 There are stale, but otherwise perfectly good sandwiches among the grocery store garbage.
-   🔎 The employees are frightened but may assist if convinced (e.g., one drives a forklift).
-   🔎 The crates contain brand new cordless drills and electric saws.
-   🔎 This is an initiation job of the new members of the Vanta Crew gang.
-   📅 If the heroes wait too long, the gang escalates the violence, beats up the employees, steals the cargo and leave.

### 🏺 Rewards

-   🎁 **Hardware store items**: Players can pick a tool (e.g., crowbar, toolkit, power tools, metal parts) as a reward. One for each surviving employee in total. Tracked by **Store Employees Alive**.
-   🎁 **Stolen SUV**: If the fleeing gang members are defeated, the heroes can take their car.

### Counters

-   **Gang's Will to Fight** total should be 2 per player.

### Resolution

_You hear sirens closing in from a distance. It's time to bounce. You leave the alley and disappear into the darkness. The Vanta Crew got what they deserved.
Now you just gotta figure out how to sneak past your parents without catching a full-blown lecture._

## Scene 2 – The Test

### 💡 Storyteller info (do not read out loud)

* **Scene summary**: It's the morning after the rooftop brawl. The teens are bruised, exhausted, and completely unprepared for their physics test. To make things worse, Rebar is spotted near the school talking to two government agents. The agents meet with the physics teacher, hinting they’re looking for students who show signs of involvement in suspicious activity—especially anyone with poor grades or unexplained injuries.
* **Setting**: A chilly, fluorescent-lit classroom with buzzing lights and a worn-out whiteboard. The players are seated at separate desks, surrounded by students who are all furiously reviewing last-minute notes.
* **Threat**: The teacher is being pressured by the agents and is extra alert to cheating or suspicious behavior.
* **Objective**: Pass the test without being caught cheating or drawing attention. Avoid revealing signs of last night’s fight.
* **Exam mechanics**: Each player must answer 4 difficult physics questions. They can use stealth or social stunts to cheat (e.g., pass notes, sneak peeks, distract the teacher, or steal answer keys).
* **Tension builder**: If caught or acting suspicious, the teacher may report them to the agents.

*Your desk feels harder than usual and your eyelids heavier. The physics classroom smells faintly of whiteboard markers, cold coffee, and teenage panic. Rain streaks across the windows in blurry lines, and outside, a black sedan idles at the curb.*
*Through a crack in the classroom door, you notice your physics teacher, ms. Vogel, speaking with two grim-looking suits who definitely don’t teach here. You move to closer to listen in. All you can make out is that they are looking with kids with some unusual skills.*
*The agents told the teacher to let them know about any suspicious students especially if they have poor grades or unexplained injuries.*

*A moment later, you stare blankly at the test with four brutal physics questions. Your brain is fried from last night’s fight, and your powers are no help here.*
*Ms. Vogel paces through the class room looking for cheaters or worse...*

🎭 **The test starts now. What do you do?**

* Agent Renata Vales
* Agent Felix Brandt
