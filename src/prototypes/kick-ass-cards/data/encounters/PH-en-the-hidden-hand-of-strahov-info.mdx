## üí° Storyteller's Summary

The Hand of Saint Norbert, a holy relic of great significance, has mysteriously vanished from the Strahov Monastery in 1461, in Prague, Bohemia. The abbot claims it was stolen, while rumors of an attempted sale begin to spread. The monastery is placed under lockdown by Hilarius of Litomƒõ≈ôice, the Catholic administrator of Prague, who suspects that someone within the monastery's walls is behind the crime.

The players take on the roles of investigators assigned to uncover the truth. The investigation involves a complex web of secrets, lies, and ambitions among the monastery's inhabitants. Each of the key characters has their own motivations, hidden pasts, and potential involvement in the theft. As the investigators gather clues, question suspects, and explore the ancient monastery, they will begin to unravel a conspiracy involving forged relics, financial desperation, and personal betrayal.

The core plot revolves around Brother Luk√°≈°, who has been secretly trying to sell the Hand of Saint Norbert for his own gain, using others within the monastery as pawns. However, his plan spiraled out of control when other characters, including Novice Tom√°≈° and Sister Tereza, became entangled in the scheme, each hiding the relic for their own reasons. Meanwhile, Brother V√°clav knows the real relic is a fake, and is hiding the true Hand of Saint Norbert to protect it from falling into the wrong hands.

Throughout the adventure, the investigators must navigate the monastery's tense atmosphere, where nearly everyone has something to hide. Trust will be hard to come by, and alliances may shift as the truth comes to light. The players will face moral choices, uncover dark secrets, and ultimately decide the fate of those involved, as well as the sacred relic itself.
