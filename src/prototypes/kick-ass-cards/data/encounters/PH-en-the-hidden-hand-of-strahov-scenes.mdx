# The Hidden Hand of Strahov - Scenes

## Scene: The Arrival at Strahov Monastery

**Setting**: It is a chilly autumn morning in 1461.

**The Investigation Team**:
1.  **Hilarius's of Litoměřice**: The Catholic administrator of Prague, Hilarius of Litoměřice, stands before the investigators, his eyes sharp beneath his fur-lined hood. His voice is stern and carries the weight of authority. Hilarius is a well known and accomplished priest. If not for the Hussite uprising, Prague would have him as it's bishop. Nevertheless, he is still the Pope's extended hand for his dealings in Prague and everyone knows it.

1.  **Johana z Rožmitálu**: The queen consort of King Jiří z Poděbrad. Johana is an influential figure, deeply committed to her husband's rule and the stability of Bohemia. Her presence here signals the importance of the investigation, as she has come to personally ensure that the monastery remains loyal to the crown. Dressed in a simple but elegant gown, she carries herself with an air of authority. Johana is sharp-witted, politically savvy, and unafraid to confront those who would undermine the king's authority.

1.  **Kateřina z Vrby**: A fierce woman, visibly hardened by years of war. She wears a practical leather coat over her armor, and her gaze is sharp and assessing. Kateřina is experienced in warfare, having fought in the Hussite wars, and her presence alone commands respect. There is a hint of pleasure in her smile when she speaks of violence, and her knowledge of battlefield tactics and interrogation is unmatched.

1.  **Sister Magdalena of Blatná**: A nun with a gentle demeanor and a calm, collected expression. She stands with confidence, holding a scroll. Dressed in the traditional habit, her eyes are observant, and her knowledge of relics is renowned. Magdalena has spent years studying and authenticating religious artifacts, and her expertise will be crucial in determining the origins of the stolen relic. Despite her composed appearance, her dedication to her work makes her formidable in uncovering secrets.

1.  **Vladimír of Komárov**: An elderly knight, whose chainmail shows signs of repair, but his sword is polished and ready. He has a long history with the Church, and his loyalty is unwavering. Vladimír is a veteran, one who has seen enough bloodshed and hardship to recognize deception when he sees it. His role is to provide protection to the investigation team, and his imposing presence serves as a warning to those who might think of interfering.

1.  **Brother Jakub of Olomouc**: A young monk with intelligent eyes and an eager expression. Jakub wears a simple robe, and carries a satchel filled with scrolls and notes. He has been sent by Hilarius to assist with the investigation. He is intelligent and ambitious, hoping that his involvement in this investigation might bring him closer to a higher standing within the Church. Jakub is also skilled at reading people, often noticing the things that others miss.

**Hilarius addresses the team of investigators:**

_"Welcome to Strahov Monastery. You have been summoned here for a matter of utmost importance to the Church and the sanctity of this place. A sacred relic, the Hand of Saint Norbert, was found here within the monastery and has now vanished. We have reason to believe there was an attempt to sell the relic. The abbot claims it was stolen, but evidence suggests involvement from within these very walls. Your task is clear: uncover who was behind this sale, and recover the relic. No one is to leave the monastery until this matter is resolved, and I have posted guards at every exit to ensure this. Trust no one and question everything."_

**Scene**: The group stands before the monastery's gate as Hilarius finishes his briefing. The investigators exchange glances, sizing each other up. Kateřina cracks her knuckles, clearly eager to begin. Sister Magdalena nods thoughtfully, already considering where to start. Vladimír rests his hand on the hilt of his sword, his eyes scanning the monks moving in and out of the courtyard. Brother Jakub shuffles his feet, eager to prove himself.

Johana steps forward, her eyes narrowing as she looks at the monastery, clearly determined to uncover the truth. Hilarius turns to the group one last time.

_"Remember, the integrity of this monastery is at stake. The truth must be uncovered, no matter how deeply it is buried."_

With that, he gestures for them to enter, and the investigation begins.
