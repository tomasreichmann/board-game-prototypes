## Spying on the priest

Welcome to the lively town of Pilsen, in South-east Bohemia. The year is 1420, and the streets are abuzz with the whispers of revolution and change, but you, a group of spirited youngsters… are… just… bored! 
As you sit near the Church of All Saints, watching the villagers go about their business, your eyes wander to the church gate. The gate creaks open and priest Zdislav sticks his bald head out to look around.

The stern, sharp-eyed priest is up to something unusual. He's standing outside the church, glancing around nervously before grabbing the poor box, a heavy wooden chest that holds donations meant for the needy, and hurries with it inside.
Your curiosity gets the best of you. Moving quietly, through the slowly closing heavy door and sneak after him. You see the priest rummaging through the box and stuffing handfuls of coins into his pockets, his eyes darting around suspiciously.

Just as you decide to slip away and tell someone, you turn back to the door and realize it's locked. Before you can react, the priest's hand is on your shoulder. He spins you around, his face a mask of fury.  
"Caught red-handed, were you? Spying on the church!" he barks.  
"If you think you can steal from God's house and get away with it, you're sorely mistaken. I could tell your were caught stealing, and they'd have you whipped till you couldn't stand!" He glares at you, waving a finger threateningly.  
"But I've got a better idea—let's see how you like doing some real work!" He shoves a long list of chores into your hands, smirking as he does.  
"Finish these by the end of the day, or I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of troublemakers you really are."  
As he locks the door behind him, you look at each other with a mix of fear and determination.

You huddle together to come up with a plan to deal with this situation. You are on the same page. You've had enough of Father Zdislav. He has to go!  
These chores give you a good reason to hang around the church, gather some evidence of his corruption and find a way to dishonor Father Zdislav in front of the townspeople during the next sermon.  
The church door is locked anyway.

## Chores

💡 The chores should give players an opportunity to mess with the priest, but failing them can also have comidic and mechanic side effects. There are some possible fumbles and sabotage listed, but if players come up with something different, better go with that.

The list of chores seems infinite. But also gives you some ideas on how to mess with the annoying priest.
-   Cleaning the Chamber Pot
-   Wiping the Floors
-   Waxing the Altar
-   Getting Rid of Ants in the Kitchen
-   Removing the Wasp Nest in the Rafters
-   Bring priest's books to the priest
-   Preparing the Holy Water, Wine, and Wafers
-   Dusting the Organ

🎭 **What do you want to start with?**

💡 Starting to play in turns at this point can speed up the game and ensure everyone gets enough time in the spotlight.

### Cleaning the Chamber Pot

The chamber pot needs to be emptied to the latrine at the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: Your clothes get stained and no matter what you do, the smell does not get off. People can smell you, when you are in the room from now on. You need to find a soap to get rid of the smell.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The poop can be saved for later use to mess with the priest's clothing.

### Wiping the Floors

The floors have mud and dirt on them. There is a rag and an old bucket by the well in the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: You slipped and tore your pants as you were falling. You can see your underpants through the hole on your butt.  
💡 Possible sabotage: You leave the bucket of water somewhere to make the priest trip over it and get wet.

### Waxing the Altar

There is some wax under the altar to make the wood shiny.

💡 Possible fumble: The kids hands get very slippy and it can get very hard to hold things properly.  
💡 Possible sabotage: You can apply wax to a lot of things to make them slippery.

### Getting Rid of Ants in the Kitchen

The ants carry leftover food on the floor to the anthill on the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid becomes itchy and paranoid about the ants.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The ants can be collected and released in the confessor to distract the priest.

### Removing the Wasp Nest in the Rafters

There is a small wasp nest in the rafters above the altar.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid gets stung, leading to a comically swollen body part. It could cause speech or movement impediment.  
💡 Possible sabotage: Swarming angry wasps are a force to be reckoned with.

### Prepare priest's book for the next sermon

You should bring the priest's notes from the study to the pulpit (an elevated platform at the front of a church, with a lectern for notes or scriptures). The notebook is old and the pages are coming apart easily.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid can trip and has to gather the pages from the floor.  
💡 Possible sabotage: They can replace a page and with an altered page replacing key phrases to have the priest say ridiculous things.

Excerpt from priest's notes bookmarked for the next sermon:

_Good people, hear the words of truth. Like a watchman guards a tower, we must protect our holy beliefs. When trouble comes, remember that God shields us from evil and sin. As a house is built brick by brick, our faith grows with each prayer. Open your ears to the wisdom of the Church, for it will lead you to heaven's gates. Reject the lies of false teachers who would lead you astray. Stay true to the old ways, and you will find peace in the end. Amen._

### Preparing the Holy Water, Wine, and Wafers

You should bring the wine, holy water, and wafers from the storage to the altar.

💡 Possible fumble: One of the bottles breaks, dousing the kid with wine making them smell like a drunk.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The wine could be replaced with vinegar or another unpleasant liquid.

### Dusting the Organ

💡 Possible fumble: The kid sneezes uncontrollably for some time.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The organ can be tampered with so that it plays off-key or makes strange noises during the sermon.

## The Confessions

It is time for people to come for confessions. You are wondering, if you could somehow get rid of father Zdislav and pretend to be the priest yourself. Or at least eavesdrop on him.

🎭 **How do you want to approach this?**

💡 Make it easy for players to impersonate the priest, it gives them the most agency in this scene.

### The Confession Booth

In the corner of the church, tucked beneath the towering stone arches, is a wooden confession booth—a new and unusual sight for the time.
The booth is simple but imposing, made of dark, weathered wood. A thin, lattice screen separates the priest's side from the penitent's, offering only a partial view of the person who kneels for confession. The screen is old-fashioned, with wide enough gaps that the priest can easily peer through, catching glimpses of the penitent’s face if they lean close enough.
Inside, a creaky wooden chair for the priest to sit on. The space is tight, and the shadows play tricks on the eyes. There's a small square opening in the lattice, where the penitent can speak quietly, but their voice still echoes faintly in the stone chapel beyond.
From the priest's side, you can see the outline of the person through the screen, but enough to make out expressions or nervous movements. The booth smells faintly of incense and aged wood, grounding you in the sacred duty about to unfold.

💡 Only read Zdislav's part if the players are only evesdropping on the priest and did not impersonated him.
💡 The issues of people comming for the confession are all connected. Read the **Storyteller's Summary** at the end so that you know what really happened.

### Baker's wife Anna

You see the Baker's wife Anna, come and take her place in the confession booth.

**Anna** (whispering, voice trembling):  
_"Father Zdislav, I fear my husband no longer loves me. Every day, I return late after a long horse ride from the market in Rokycany, tired but… burning for him. But he rejects me, he shoos me, says he’s tired, makes up excuses that I smell or something… I thought maybe… maybe he was seeing another woman."_

**Zdislav** (sighing, uninterested):  
_"And?"_

**Anna** (pleading):  
_"I… I went to the old hermit. He gave me a tea—something to keep my husband awake, make him… desire me. But it didn't work! He just fell asleep again. I must be a terrible wife. What do I do, Father?"_

**Zdislav** (snorting, leaning forward to peek through the screen):  
_"A tea? From that old quack? Foolish woman. If your husband doesn’t want you anymore, that is his right."_

**Anna** (stunned, tearful):  
_"But Father—"_

**Zdislav** (cutting her off, waving a dismissive hand):  
_"Don’t waste my time with your nonsense. Say three Hail Marys and for God's sake, stop pestering your husband with your lustful desires."_

**Anna** (softly, defeated):  
_"Yes, Father…"_

**Zdislav** (impatiently):  
_"Go on, go!"_

Anna stands up and leaves with a shameful hurried shuffle.

### Dairy Farmer

You see the Jaromír, the dairy farmer enter the booth and sit down carefully.

**Jaromír** (suspiciously, whispering): _"Father Zdislav, I think… I think God is punishing me."_

**Zdislav** (bored): _"For what this time, Jaromír?"_

**Jaromír** (earnestly, voice rising a little): _"Last week, all my cheese has hone so hard I could not sell it anymore. I was mad, I was screeming and cursing and I may have taken the Lord’s name in vain on one or… dosen occasions. Since then, I’ve been… well… blocked up. Haven’t been able to, uh, relieve myself for seven days. I immediately realized this is Gods way of telling me I sinned. I even went to the old hermit, he sold me some herbs for that. It didn’t help with my guts, but ever since then, things don't tend to bother me that much. I am just curious though. Is this really God's doing, or is it normal to be constipated for this long?"_

**Zdislav** (sighing, impatiently waving him off): _"God has better things to do than mess with your gut, Jaromír. Say a few prayers, go, and stop troubling me with your shit."_

**Jaromír** (unsure, but obedient): _"If you say so, Father… thank you."_

**Zdislav** (curtly): _"Go…"_

Jaromír very slowly stands up, farts and wobbles away in shame.

### Baker Václav

**Václav (whispering nervously)**:  
_"Father Zdislav, I need your help. My wife, bless her heart, she… she’s been wanting to lie with me more and more lately, but… well, she smells like a horse’s ass. Every time she comes back from the market, it’s unbearable. But if I even hint at it, she flies into a rage! Says I don’t love her, accuses me of seeing someone else."_

**Zdislav (rolling his eyes)**:  
_"And you’ve come to me for what, exactly?"_

**Václav (sighing, running his hands through his hair)**:  
_"I don’t know what to do, Father! I’m so stressed, I can’t even focus on my baking anymore. To make things worse, the town guard keeps pestering me, accusing me of being a Hussite! Me, a Hussite? I swear on the Holy Cross, I’m just a god-fearing Christian trying to make a living. He threatens to throw me in jail, my hands are shaking, I can't even—"* 

**Zdislav (grunting impatiently)**:  
_"Why should I waste my time dealing with that bugger?"_

**Václav (desperate)**:  
_"I even went to the old hermit, asked him for tea to calm my nerves, but that didn’t work either. I need your help, please. Just talk to the guard, tell them I’m no heretic!"_

**Zdislav (grunts in annoyance)**:  
_"Huh."_

**Václav (shamefully, hesitating)**:  
_"There’s… one more thing, Father. Something I’m deeply ashamed of. Lately, at work… when I’m kneading the dough, or glazing the pastries… I, uh… I’ve been getting… excited. Especially around the donuts. I know it’s sinful, I know, but I can’t help it. It’s… it’s been haunting me."_

**Zdislav (smirking, with a cruel chuckle)**:  
_"Aroused by donuts, Václav? You truly are a sad case. I’ll tell you this: Say a few prayers and try to keep your wiener out of the dough. Now get out."_

**Václav (defeated)**:  
_"Yes, Father… thank you."_

**Zdislav (coldly)**:  
_"Just leave already!"_

Václav hurries to leave the booth, forgetting a flask with his tea.

### Guard František

**František (grumbling, entering the booth)**:  
_"Father Zdislav, I need your counsel. No confession today."_

**Zdislav (sighing)**:  
_"Always something with you František. What is it now?"_

**František (angry)**:  
_"It’s that damn hermit! I went to him for some herbs to help me sleep after my night shift. He gives me some tea, says it’ll do the trick. But what happens? I drink it, and now I’ve got the shits! Now I cannot sleep **and** I run to the privy every hour. I want to get back at him. You must hear things—gossip about that hermit. Anything I can use to give him some trouble? Maybe report him for something… unholy?"_

**Zdislav (shrugging, unimpressed)**:  
_"The only thing unholy about him is his smell. If you can’t handle a bit of diarrhea, that’s on you."_

**František (frowning, shifting gears)**:  
_"Speaking of smell… I visited the baker, Václav. He’s been acting very strange lately, jittery, like a rat caught in a trap. Something’s off with him. I’m telling you, he’s got Hussite sympathies. Might even be in league with the devils. He was sweating like a harlot in a church when I showed up at his bakery today."_

**Zdislav (snorting)**:  
_"Václav? A Hussite? That man’s afraid of his own shadow, much less a rebellion. He was here a moment ago, telling me you are giving him a hard time. Go easy on him, František, he has a horse-load of trouble on his own…"_

**František (persisting)**:  
_"He tried bribing me with his donuts, too. He’s come up with a new recipe, too. I must say, they are deliciously juicy, but with a bit of a… strange aroma. You should try one."_

František pulls out a donut and offers it to Zdislav. Then makes a face and grabs his but.

**František (with a twisted face, stands up to leave)**:  
_"I gotta go! Thanks for nothing, Father. Enjoy the donut."_

František gets up and casually walks out, leaving a donut on the chair.

### 💡 Storyteller's Summary

## Characters and Their Issues

1. **Anna (Baker's wife)**
   - She believes her husband no longer loves her, because she does not listen to him, when he is trying to tell her she smells bad.
   - She bought tea from hermit that should have kept her husband awake and increased his desire.
   - She actually got a sleeping draught (meant for the guard František)

2. **Jaromír (Dairy Farmer)**
   - Issue: Constipation and stress over cursing
   - Bought from hermit: Herbs for constipation
   - Actually received: Calming herbs (possibly cannabis)

3. **Václav (Baker)**
   - Issues: 
     a) Wife's unpleasant odor
     b) Stress from guard's accusations
     c) Unusual arousal at work
   - Bought from hermit: Tea to calm nerves
   - Actually received: Mild hallucinogenic/aphrodisiac

4. **František (Guard)**
   - Issue: Headache
   - Bought from hermit: Herbs for headache
   - Actually received: Laxative

## The Hermit's Mixup

The old hermit, either through confusion or mischief, has given each person the wrong remedy:

- Anna's desire-enhancing tea went to František (causing diarrhea)
- František's headache cure went to Václav (causing hallucinations and arousal)
- Václav's calming tea went to Anna (making her husband sleepy)
- Jaromír's constipation cure went to Václav (adding to his unusual sensations)

This mixup has created a comical chain of misunderstandings and new problems for each character, culminating in the confessions we see in the script.

## Additional Notes

- The guard's suspicions about Václav being a Hussite are unfounded and likely due to Václav's strange behavior caused by the hermit's tea.
- Václav's new donut recipe might be influenced by his accidental consumption of the hermit's herbs, leading to the "strange aroma" František mentioned.
- Father Zdislav seems uninterested in genuinely helping his parishioners, adding to the comedic tension of the situation.
