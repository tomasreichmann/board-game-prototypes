## Spying on the priest

Welcome to the lively town of Pilsen, in South-east Bohemia. The year is 1420, and the streets are abuzz with the whispers of revolution and change, but you, a group of spirited youngsters… are… just… bored! 
As you sit near the Church of All Saints, watching the villagers go about their business, your eyes wander to the church gate. The gate creaks open and priest Zdislav sticks his bald head out to look around.

The stern, sharp-eyed priest is up to something unusual. He's standing outside the church, glancing around nervously before grabbing the poor box, a heavy wooden chest that holds donations meant for the needy, and hurries with it inside.
Your curiosity gets the best of you. Moving quietly, through the slowly closing heavy door and sneak after him. You see the priest rummaging through the box and stuffing handfuls of coins into his pockets, his eyes darting around suspiciously.

Just as you decide to slip away and tell someone, you turn back to the door and realize it's locked. Before you can react, the priest's hand is on your shoulder. He spins you around, his face a mask of fury.  
"Caught red-handed, were you? Spying on the church!" he barks.  
"If you think you can steal from God's house and get away with it, you're sorely mistaken. I could tell your were caught stealing, and they'd have you whipped till you couldn't stand!" He glares at you, waving a finger threateningly.  
"But I've got a better idea—let's see how you like doing some real work!" He shoves a long list of chores into your hands, smirking as he does.  
"Finish these by the end of the day, or I'll make sure everyone knows what kind of troublemakers you really are."  
As he locks the door behind him, you look at each other with a mix of fear and determination.

![](/KAC/encounters/though_shalt_not_prank/father_zdislav.jpg)

You huddle together to come up with a plan to deal with this situation. You are on the same page. You've had enough of Father Zdislav. He has to go!  
These chores give you a good reason to hang around the church, gather some evidence of his corruption and find a way to dishonor Father Zdislav in front of the townspeople during the next sermon.  
The church door is locked anyway.

## Chores

💡 The chores should give players an opportunity to mess with the priest, but failing them can also have comidic and mechanic side effects. There are some possible fumbles and sabotage listed, but if players come up with something different, better go with that.

The list of chores seems infinite. But also gives you some ideas on how to mess with the annoying priest.
-   Cleaning the Chamber Pot
-   Wiping the Floors
-   Waxing the Altar
-   Getting Rid of Ants in the Kitchen
-   Removing the Wasp Nest in the Rafters
-   Bring priest's books to the priest
-   Preparing the Holy Water, Wine, and Wafers
-   Dusting the Organ

🎭 **What do you want to start with?**

💡 Starting to play in turns at this point can speed up the game and ensure everyone gets enough time in the spotlight.

### Cleaning the Chamber Pot

The chamber pot needs to be emptied to the latrine at the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: Your clothes get stained and no matter what you do, the smell does not get off. People can smell you, when you are in the room from now on. You need to find a soap to get rid of the smell.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The poop can be saved for later use to mess with the priest's clothing.

### Wiping the Floors

The floors have mud and dirt on them. There is a rag and an old bucket by the well in the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: You slipped and tore your pants as you were falling. You can see your underpants through the hole on your butt.  
💡 Possible sabotage: You leave the bucket of water somewhere to make the priest trip over it and get wet.

### Waxing the Altar

There is some wax under the altar to make the wood shiny.

💡 Possible fumble: The kids hands get very slippy and it can get very hard to hold things properly.  
💡 Possible sabotage: You can apply wax to a lot of things to make them slippery.

### Getting Rid of Ants in the Kitchen

The ants carry leftover food on the floor to the anthill on the back yard.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid becomes itchy and paranoid about the ants.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The ants can be collected and released in the confessor to distract the priest.

### Removing the Wasp Nest in the Rafters

There is a small wasp nest in the rafters above the altar.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid gets stung, leading to a comically swollen body part. It could cause speech or movement impediment.  
💡 Possible sabotage: Swarming angry wasps are a force to be reckoned with.

### Prepare priest's book for the next sermon

You should bring the priest's notes from the study to the pulpit (an elevated platform at the front of a church, with a lectern for notes or scriptures). The notebook is old and the pages are coming apart easily.

💡 Possible fumble: The kid can trip and has to gather the pages from the floor.  
💡 Possible sabotage: They can replace a page and with an altered page replacing key phrases to have the priest say ridiculous things. They can draw revolting images in the journal, put lude drawings in between the pages of his bible.

**Excerpt from priest's notes bookmarked for the next sermon:**

_Good people, hear the words of truth. Like a watchman guards a tower, we must protect our holy beliefs. When trouble comes, remember that God shields us from evil and sin. As a house is built brick by brick, our faith grows with each prayer. Open your ears to the wisdom of the Church, for it will lead you to heaven's gates. Reject the lies of false teachers who would lead you astray. Stay true to the old ways, and you will find peace in the end. Amen._

### Preparing the Holy Water, Wine, and Wafers

You should bring the wine, holy water, and wafers from the storage to the altar.

💡 Possible fumble: One of the bottles breaks, dousing the kid with wine making them smell like a drunk.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The wine could be replaced with vinegar or another unpleasant liquid.

### Dusting the Organ

💡 Possible fumble: The kid sneezes uncontrollably for some time.  
💡 Possible sabotage: The organ can be tampered with so that it plays off-key or makes strange noises during the sermon.

## The Confessions

It is time for people to come for confessions. You are wondering, if you could somehow get rid of father Zdislav and pretend to be the priest yourself. Or at least eavesdrop on him.

🎭 **How do you want to approach this?**

💡 Make it easy for players to impersonate the priest, it gives them the most agency in this scene.

### The Confession Booth

In the corner of the church, tucked beneath the towering stone arches, is a wooden confession booth—a new and unusual sight for the time.
The booth is simple but imposing, made of dark, weathered wood. A thin, lattice screen separates the priest's side from the penitent's, offering only a partial view of the person who kneels for confession. The screen is old-fashioned, with wide enough gaps that the priest can easily peer through, catching glimpses of the penitent’s face if they lean close enough.
Inside, a creaky wooden chair for the priest to sit on. The space is tight, and the shadows play tricks on the eyes. There's a small square opening in the lattice, where the penitent can speak quietly, but their voice still echoes faintly in the stone chapel beyond.
From the priest's side, you can see the outline of the person through the screen, but enough to make out expressions or nervous movements. The booth smells faintly of incense and aged wood, grounding you in the sacred duty about to unfold.

💡 Only read Zdislav's part if the players are only evesdropping on the priest and did not impersonated him.
💡 The issues of people comming for the confession are all connected. Read the **Storyteller's Summary** at the end so that you know what really happened.

### Baker's wife Anna

You see the Baker's wife Anna, come and take her place in the confession booth.

🎭 Feel free to cut in.

**Anna** (whispering, voice trembling):  
_"Father Zdislav, I fear my husband no longer loves me. Every day, I return late after a long horse ride from the market in Rokycany, tired but… burning for him. But he rejects me, he shoos me, says he’s tired, makes up excuses that I smell or something… I thought maybe… maybe he was seeing another woman."_

**Zdislav** (sighing, uninterested):  
_"And?"_

**Anna** (pleading):  
_"I… I went to the old hermit Boleslav. He gave me a tea—something to keep my husband awake, make him… desire me. But it didn't work! He just fell asleep again. I must be a terrible wife. What do I do, Father?"_

**Zdislav** (snorting, leaning forward to peek through the screen):  
_"A tea? From that old quack? Foolish woman. If your husband doesn’t want you anymore, that is his right."_

**Anna** (stunned, tearful):  
_"But Father—"_

**Zdislav** (cutting her off, waving a dismissive hand):  
_"Don’t waste my time with your nonsense. Say three Hail Marys and for God's sake, stop pestering your husband with your lustful desires."_

**Anna** (softly, defeated):  
_"Yes, Father…"_

**Zdislav** (impatiently):  
_"Go on, go!"_

Anna stands up and leaves with a shameful hurried shuffle.

### Dairy Farmer Jaromír

You see the Jaromír, the dairy farmer enter the booth and sit down carefully.

🎭 Feel free to cut in.

**Jaromír** (suspiciously, whispering):  
_"Father Zdislav, I think… I think God is punishing me."_

**Zdislav** (bored):  
_"For what this time, Jaromír?"_

**Jaromír** (earnestly, voice rising a little):  
_"Last week, all my cheese has hone so hard I could not sell it anymore. I was mad, I was screeming and cursing and I may have taken the Lord’s name in vain on one or… dosen occasions. Since then, I’ve been… well… blocked up. Haven’t been able to, uh, relieve myself for seven days. I immediately realized this is Gods way of telling me I sinned. I even went to the old hermit Boleslav, he sold me some herbs for that. It didn’t help with my guts, but ever since then, things don't tend to bother me that much. I am just curious though. Is this really God's doing, or is it normal to be constipated for this long?"_

**Zdislav** (sighing, impatiently waving him off):  
_"God has better things to do than mess with your gut, Jaromír. Say a few prayers, go, and stop troubling me with your shit."_

**Jaromír** (unsure, but obedient):  
_"If you say so, Father… thank you."_

**Zdislav** (curtly):  
_"Go…"_

Jaromír very slowly stands up, farts and wobbles away in shame.

### Baker Václav

Baker Václav with his head down breathes heavily and stumbles into the confession booth.

🎭 Feel free to cut in.

**Václav (whispering nervously)**:  
_"Father Zdislav, I need your help. My wife, bless her heart, she… she’s been wanting to lie with me more and more lately, but… well, she smells like a horse’s ass. Every time she comes back from the market, it’s unbearable. But if I even hint at it, she flies into a rage! Says I don’t love her, accuses me of seeing someone else."_

**Zdislav (rolling his eyes)**:  
_"And you’ve come to me for what, exactly?"_

**Václav (sighing, running his hands through his hair)**:  
_"I don’t know what to do, Father! I’m so stressed, I can’t even focus on my baking anymore. To make things worse, the town guard keeps pestering me, accusing me of being a Hussite! Me, a Hussite? I swear on the Holy Cross, I’m just a god-fearing Christian trying to make a living. He threatens to throw me in jail, my hands are shaking, I can't even—"* 

**Zdislav (grunting impatiently)**:  
_"Why should I waste my time dealing with that bugger?"_

**Václav (desperate)**:  
_"I even went to the old hermit, asked him for tea to calm my nerves, but that didn’t work either. I need your help, please. Just talk to the guard, tell them I’m no heretic!"_

**Zdislav (grunts in annoyance)**:  
_"Huh."_

**Václav (shamefully, hesitating)**:  
_"There’s… one more thing, Father. Something I’m deeply ashamed of. Lately, at work… when I’m kneading the dough, or glazing the pastries… I, uh… I’ve been getting… excited. Especially around the donuts. I know it’s sinful, I know, but I can’t help it. It’s… it’s been haunting me."_

**Zdislav (smirking, with a cruel chuckle)**:  
_"Aroused by donuts, Václav? You truly are a sad case. I’ll tell you this: Say a few prayers and try to keep your wiener out of the dough. Now get out."_

**Václav (defeated)**:  
_"Yes, Father… thank you."_

**Zdislav (coldly)**:  
_"Just leave already!"_

Václav hurries to leave the booth, forgetting a flask with his tea.

### Guard František

Guard František in his uniform holding a small bag suddenly enters the booth.

🎭 Feel free to cut in.

**František (grumbling, entering the booth)**:  
_"Father Zdislav, I need your counsel. No confession today."_

**Zdislav (sighing)**:  
_"Always something with you František. What is it now?"_

**František (angry)**:  
_"It’s that damn hermit Boleslav! I went to him for some herbs to help me sleep after my night shift. He gives me some tea, says it’ll do the trick. But what happens? I drink it, and now I’ve got the shits! Now I cannot sleep **and** I run to the privy every hour. I want to get back at him. You must hear things—gossip about that hermit. Anything I can use to give him some trouble? Maybe report him for something… unholy?"_

**Zdislav (shrugging, unimpressed)**:  
_"The only thing unholy about him is his smell. If you can’t handle a bit of diarrhea, that’s on you."_

**František (frowning, shifting gears)**:  
_"Speaking of smell… I visited the baker, Václav. He’s been acting very strange lately, jittery, like a rat caught in a trap. Something’s off with him. I’m telling you, he’s got Hussite sympathies. Might even be in league with the devils. He was sweating like a harlot in a church when I showed up at his bakery today."_

**Zdislav (snorting)**:  
_"Václav? A Hussite? That man’s afraid of his own shadow, much less a rebellion. He was here a moment ago, telling me you are giving him a hard time. Go easy on him, František, he has a horse-load of trouble on his own…"_

**František (persisting)**:  
_"He tried bribing me with his donuts, too. He’s come up with a new recipe, too. I must say, they are deliciously juicy, but with a bit of a… strange aroma. You should try one."_

František pulls out a donut and offers it to Zdislav. Then makes a face and grabs his but.

**František (with a twisted face, stands up to leave)**:  
_"I gotta go! Thanks for nothing, Father. Enjoy the donut."_

František gets up and casually walks out, leaving a donut on the chair.

### 💡 Storyteller's Summary

Several people from the town of Pilsen went to see the old hermit Boleslav for help. He has (probably by mistake) given each person the wrong remedy.

1. **Anna (Baker's wife)**
   - She believes her husband no longer loves her, because she does not listen to him, when he is trying to tell her she smells bad.
   - She bought tea from hermit that should have kept her husband awake and increased his desire.
   - She actually got a sleeping draught (meant for the guard František)

2. **Jaromír (Dairy Farmer)**
   - He believes god cursed him with constipation.
   - He bought from hermit a supposed laxative.
   - He actually received some calming herbs. (meant for the baker Václav)

3. **Václav (Baker)**
   - He is stressed from the guard František threatning him to throw him to jail on suspection on being a hussite. Also His wife wants to have sex with him while having an unplesant odor after a long horse-ride home.
   - He bought a supposed tea to calm nerves from the hermit.
   - He actually received a tea to keep awake and promote desire (meant for the guard František)

4. **František (Guard)**
   - He cannot sleep after his night shift
   - He bought supposed herbs for sleeping from the hermit.
   - He actually received a laxative (meant for the dairy farmer Jaromír)

#### 💡 Additional Notes

- The guard's suspicions about Václav being a Hussite are unfounded and likely due to Václav's strange behavior caused by the hermit's tea.
- Václav's new donut recipe might be influenced by his accidental consumption of the hermit's herbs, leading to the "strange aroma" František mentioned.
- Father Zdislav seems uninterested in genuinely helping his parishioners.

### End of the day

The sun is slowly on it's way behind the horizon and father Zdislav finally releases you from your duties at the church. Before going home for dinner you briefly stop at your favourate hangout spot.

🎭 Discuss the events of the day and how to procede with your plan to ridicule father Zdislav during tomorrow's Sunday Mass.

## The Mass

_As the morning sun filters through the stained glass windows of the church, the congregation begins to gather for the Sunday mass. The air is thick with anticipation and the faint scent of incense. Father Zdislav, looking slightly uneasy, adjusts his robes near the altar._

Among the crowd, you spot some familiar faces:

-   Anna, the baker's wife, fidgets nervously in her seat, casting a frowning glances at her husband Václav. The baker himself seems distracted, his eyes darting around the church nervously.
-   Jaromír, the dairy farmer, shifts uncomfortably in his pew, his face a mix of discomfort and unusual serenity.
-   Near the back, František the guard stands leaning at a pillar, his stern gaze sweeping across the congregation. He winces occasionally, as if thinking about leaving, then changing his mind.
-   Several people seem to frown as the old hermit Boleslav.


_As the church bells toll, signaling the start of the mass, there's a palpable tension in the air. Something feels off, as if the usual solemnity of the occasion has been replaced by an undercurrent of chaos waiting to be unleashed. Little do the good people of this parish know that their Sunday worship is about to become an unforgettable event, for reasons they could never imagine…_

💡 As you describe this scene to your players, remind them of their mischievous plans and the opportunities that lie before them. The mass is about to begin, and the stage is set for mayhem.

### Processional

_As the clergy and assistants enter the church, a church boy begins to play the organ and Father Zdislav enters stumbling slightly and procedes to the altar._

💡 Possible sabotage: slippery ground, stained or itchy robes, out of tune organ.

### Introductory Rites

_Father Zdislav begins the opening prayers, his voice strained and sweaty. He keeps shifting uncomfortably._

💡 Possible sabotage: fake text, over-waxed altar.

### Liturgy of the Word and homily

_Father Zdislav opens the Bible and begins to read from the scripture in latin. You immediatelly tune out and look around. You notice an unattended incense burner hanging from the rafters, slowly swinging in the air, smoke trailing behind it._

💡 Possible sabotage: the incense burner can be sabotaged with the tea or something smelly.

### Liturgy of the Eucharist and the Communion

_Father Zdislav presents the communion wine and wafers and starts to consecrate them to become the blood and body of Christ. He motions for people to form a line in front of the altar to receive the communion wafers as the body of Christ. You notice some people exchange glances when the priest grabs the decorated challice and licks his lips before gulping down the wine._

💡 Possible sabotage: the wine and wafers, slippery challice.

### Concluding Rites and Recessional

_Father Zdislav seems to rush through the final prayers and blessings in attempt to wrap this up as quickly as possible. This is the last part before the mass is over._

🎭 If Zdislav's composure still holds, it is time to get creative and make him snap before he leaves.

💡 Take turns terrorizing the priest until he snaps. The priest can throw things at the kids to give Injury or scare them with threats them to give them Distress.

**📅 Zdislav snaps**

💡 Remove **Father Zdislav's composure** Counter.

_Father Zdislav's face contorts with a mix of pain, confusion, and unbridled rage. His eyes, bloodshot and wild, lock onto the group of snickering children huddled in the back pew._

_"You!" he bellows, his voice echoing off the stone walls. "You little demons! I know it was you!"_

_The congregation falls silent, all eyes turning to the trembling priest. Zdislav's face is beet red, a vein pulsing visibly on his forehead. He points a shaking finger at the kids._

_"I've had enough of your tricks and troubles! Satan himself must have sent you to torment me!"_

Suddenly, he lunges forward, grabbing a nearby candlestick. "I'll beat the devil out of you myself!"

The children scatter, screaming and laughing as they dash towards the church doors. Zdislav gives chase, his robes flapping wildly, the candlestick raised above his head.

_"Come back here, you little heathens!" he shouts, stumbling down the aisle. "I'll tan your hides and hang you from the bell tower!"_

As the kids burst out into the sunlight, Zdislav follows in a fit of rage spouting insults and threats.

## The Chase

You bolt from the church, laughter bubbling up as you hear the angry stomping of Father Zdislav hot on your heels. People are staring at the strange scene giving you the opportunity.

### Jaromír’s Dairy Farm

You ran from the church directly to Jaromír’s dairy farm. The air smells of milk, fresh linens, and the pungent aroma of aging Syrečky cheese.

As you race through the farm, you’ll need to decide which path to take—each offering both dangers and opportunities to humiliate the priest.

🎭 **Which path do you choose?**
    -   Through the hanging laundry
    -   Through the cow pen
    -   Through the cheese cellar


#### Through the Hanging Laundry

_You duck under the wooden poles where Jaromír’s family has hung freshly washed linens and clothing. Sheets flap in the breeze, creating a maze of white fabric._

- **Fumble**: You stumble, and a pair of large wet bloomers and a bright-colored apron slaps you in the face. As you burst out the other side, you you find you are wearing…
    -   a skirt around your neck
    -   a bra hooked across your shoulder
    -   underpants on your head
- **Opportunity**: You have a selection of laundry to tear free and tossing it at the priest.

#### Through the Cow Pen

_You leap over the fence into the cow pen. The heavy beasts moo lazily as you dodge around them, careful to avoid the piles of manure dotting the ground._

- **Fumble**: _You misjudge a step, and your foot lands smack in a fresh pile of steaming cow dung. You slip and tumble, covered in the muck as one of the cows gives you a curious nudge._
- **Opportunity**: _One of the cows gives you a perfect chance—its udders hanging full of warm milk. Next to it there is a fresh pile of steaming cow dung._

#### Through the Cheese Cellar

_You dart into the cool, dimly lit cheese storage, where rows of smelly Syrečky and other cheeses are aging on wooden racks. The pungent stench fills your nose as you navigate between piles of soft, creamy cheese._

- **Fumble**: _You take a corner too sharply, skidding into a rack of cheeses. A cascade of soft, gooey Syrečky topples onto you, covering you in its strong-smelling, sticky mess. You stumble out of the cellar reeking like a walking cheese wheel._
- **Opportunity**: _You see a rack of the stinkiest, ripest Syrečky up for grabs._

But you’re not out of the woods yet—the chase continues into the heart of the town!  
With each stumble and prank, Father Zikmund’s curses growing louder and his dignity is slipping further away, but he’s still determined to catch you. The chase is far from over, and the next location awaits!

---

### The Marketplace

After escaping Jaromír’s dairy farm, you dash into the bustling marketplace, weaving through the lively crowd of vendors and townsfolk. The smell of fresh vegetables, herbs, and warm pastries fills the air as you dodge around carts and stalls. Father Zikmund is still hot on your heels, red-faced and fuming. 

The marketplace offers a chaotic variety of paths to lose the priest—or further humiliate him.

🎭 **Which path do you choose?**
   - Through the vegetable stalls
   - Through old hermit Boleslav’s apothecary
   - Through Václav’s bakery

#### Through the Vegetable Stalls

_You dart between rows of vegetable carts, where merchants loudly hawk their produce. Piles of fresh and not so fresh cabbages, radishes, and turnips are stacked high, ready for sale._

- **Fumble**: _You bump into one of the stalls, sending a tower of cabbages tumbling to the ground. In the chaos, you trip and fall, getting tangled in a mess of squashed vegetables. As you scramble up, you’re now covered in a mix of turnip mash and cabbage leaves._
- **Opportunity**: _You see a bin of squished tomatoes and rotten vegetables_

#### Through Old Hermit Boleslav’s Apothecary

_You slip into the small, cluttered apothecary shop of the old hermit Boleslav, the town’s eccentric herbalist. The shelves are lined with jars of strange herbs, powders, and remedies. The air smells of pungent plants and mystery potions._

- **Fumble**: _In your haste, you knock over a jar of dried herbs, sending a cloud of powdery sage into the air. You start coughing uncontrollably, your eyes watering as you stumble through the shop, barely able to see. Worse yet, you’re now covered in a fine layer of strange-smelling herbs._
- **Opportunity**: _You spot a basket of dried chili peppers and several jars of labeled remedies ready for pickup like "Laughing gas", "Magic poweder" and many more._

#### Through Václav’s Bakery

_You dash past Václav’s bakery, where the windows are filled with fresh loaves of bread and pastries. Inside, trays of warm buns and tarts cool on the counter. You can’t help but notice the humorously suggestive shapes of some of the pastries._

- **Fumble**: _You slip on some flour scattered on the ground and crash into a tray of bust shaped pastries. You’re now covered in flour and cream filling._
- **Opportunity**: _You see a tray of suggestively shaped pastries filled with marmelade cooling on the windowsill._

---

### The Fair

After the chaos of the marketplace, you sprint into the heart of the fairgrounds, where colorful tents and lively performances are in full swing. The crowds cheer, music plays, and the air is filled with the smells of roasting meats, sawdust, and incense. Father Zikmund is still chasing after you, his robes now disheveled and stained, but his rage only growing.

The fair offers a wide range of distractions and diversions—perfect for losing the priest or causing him even further embarrassment.

🎭 **Which path do you choose?**
   - Through the circus
   - Through the red tent
   - Through the smoking tent


#### Through the Circus Performance

_You dash into a large open tent where a circus performance is underway. Acrobats swing overhead and a clown juggles brightly colored balls. The audience claps and laughs, unaware of the mayhem you’re about to cause._

- **Fumble**: _As you dart through, you trip over a tightrope walker’s equipment, sending the poor performer crashing into the clown. The juggling act falls apart, and you find yourself covered in colorful balls and clown makeup._
- **Opportunity**: _You notice a big suitcase of clown's silly props._


#### Through the Cheeky Adult Tent

_You slip into a smaller, less conspicuous tent where muffled laughter and gasps can be heard. Inside, provocatively dressed performers engage in silly skits and sensual dances. The audience is focused on the cheeky humor unfolding on stage. Brightly colored costumes and suggestive props are scattered everywhere._

- **Fumble**: _You stumble into the audience, tripping into one of the dancers mid-performance. They gasp in mock offense, and suddenly you’re at the center of of the show, surrounded by laughing guests._
- **Opportunity**: _There’s a table full of silly props and costumes._


#### Through the Firebreather’s Tent

_You race into a dimly lit tent where a fire show is underway. The firebreather takes center stage, spitting huge flames into the air while assistants juggle fiery torches around him. The audience sits on the edge of their seats, captivated by the dangerous, flickering light._

- **Fumble**: _You misjudge a turn, stepping into a basket of flamable liquid and setting your pants on fire as you crash into one of the performers. The crowd applauds._
- **Opportunity**: _The firebreather has left behind a pile of flash powder, torches, and buckets of oil._

---

### The Wedding Reception

_As you burst out of the fairgrounds into the garden, you find yourself in the middle of an ongoing wedding reception. Beautifully set tables are overflowing with exquisite food, drinks, and decorations. Suddenly, Father Zdislav crashes through the crowd into the wedding cake. It topples over in slow motion, splattering across the immaculate lawn and cutting off your escape route. The startled guests form a circle around you, creating an impromptu arena for this final confrontation._

- **Cornered:** The collapsing cake and the ring of shocked onlookers have trapped you. There's no slipping away this time – you must face Father Zdislav head-on.
- **David vs. Goliath:** The priest towers over you, his face purple with rage and his robes stained with the evidence of your mischievous chase. His size and strength make a physical confrontation impossible.
- **A Battle of Wits:** Your only hope lies in outsmarting Zdislav. You must use your cunning to expose his madness and turn the crowd against him.
- **The Stage is Set:** You scramble atop the reception table, sending plates clattering and glasses toppling. This precarious perch becomes your stage for the final act of this farcical play.
- **The Breaking Point:** In Zdislav's eyes, you see a dangerous mix of fury and desperation. He's a man on the edge, his composure fractured by your relentless pranks. One more push might send him tumbling into a full meltdown.
- **The Audience Awaits:** The wedding guests watch with a mix of horror and fascination. Their loyalties hang in the balance – will they see a holy man rightfully punishing troublemakers, or a madman terrorizing children?

**📅 Father Zdislav leaves in shame**

_Zdislav suddenly drops to his knees. His eyes burst into tears. Someone in the crowd shouts at him: "Enough Zdislav, look at what you've become. You are a disgrace."  
Other wedding guests join in shouting at the broken priest:  
"You have ruined our wedding!",  
"You are a monster!",  
"Leave the poor kids alone!",  
"You are a disgrace to the church!"._

_The guard František emerges from the crowd and takes the sorry priest away. Meanwhile you, scratched, bruised, but with smiles on your face, leave the garden, grabbing some unattended food and beer on your way out._

_In the following days, nobody talked about anything but the disgrace of Father Zdislav. It has become apparent he was stealing from the church, using secrets learned in confessions for his personal gain and event threatning some young ladies with god's wrath to get his way with them._

_Later you learned the priest left Pilsen and even the Catholic church and lives now in the middle of the forest. Shying away from people and especially kids._

_You, on the other hand, have become Pilsen's heroes. At least to the other kids in town._

🎭 **But now, how do you celebrate your victory?**

Thank you for playing. I hope you enjoyed the game.
