## Setting

-   **Throne of Hawthorn** takes place in the Kingdom of Trnice a fictional slavic medieval fantasy kingdom. The players are heroes and aristocrats of the noble house of Hrotec.

## Important characters and locations

-   **Kingdom of Trnice** - A small, landlocked kingdom nestled between steep mountain ranges covered by swaths of various thorny bushes, giving it its prickly name.
-   **King Miroslav of Hlohovec** - He ruled Trnice for ten years before his sudden death last year at the age of 39. King Miroslav squandered the kingdom's treasures on rebuilding the capital and let further parts of the kingdom fall into disrepair. Thinking himself immortal, Miroslav didn't officially name his heir and left the succession of the crown open to interpretation.
-   **King Svatopluk of Hlohovec** - Even though younger than his sister Rostislava, Svatopluk seized the crown shortly after his father's death while his older (and by many considered much more competent) sister was away.
-   **Lady Rostislava of Hlohovec** - Old King Miroslav's oldest child, Lady Rostislava was her father's extended arm that ruled outside of the capital in her father's name. Having a reputation as a ruthless negotiator, she made as many allies as enemies. She expected the crown to be passed to her, but several powerful lords chose to give support to her younger brother instead.
-   **Capital City of Hlohovec** - A historical capital city of Trnice for more than a hundred years. An expensive renovation of the citadel by King Miroslav made it into a lavish and modern seat and compromised much of the city's military security.
-   **Noble House of Hrotec** - An old noble family from Hrotec. When King Miroslav sold the town of Hrotec to the neighbouring Kingdom of Gorica, having no more lands, the family left the town for the capital. Before they arrived, King Miroslav died and left the family to fend for themselves in the capital.
-   **Castle ≈†pice** - An old castle in the mountains that guarded the eastern border with kingdoms of Gorica and Brezlan. It was recently granted to the noble house of Hrotec to secure the new eastern border after the town of Hrotec was sold to Gorica.
-   **Ota ze Skoryce** - A leader of a bandit group **Swift Arrows** operating in the woods in the ≈†pice region.

## Extended rules

This adventure uses standard Kick Ass Cards rules extended with following rules.

### Wealth

Players don't have to track their money. Instead they are tracking a level of wealth and a number of incomes of their level as a group.  
For example: A character of level 1 wealth has at least a single income of level 1. They don't not need to worry about having enough money for food and shelter, but cannot afford any luxury like wine and does not own any real estate.  
When they receive another level 1 income and reach a total of 2 level 1 incomes, they merge into a single level 2 income and they attend a level 2 wealth. That means they can live comfortably enjoing some luxury, medicine, perhaps owning a small house.
If they loose their only level 2 income, they drop to wealth level 1 for one week and need to secure at least a level 1 income in order to stay at this level.  
Each level has a different lenght of time the character can stay at this level living off their savings. Finding a treasure of a certain level is like having a temporary income of the same level for the duration of savings for that level.
