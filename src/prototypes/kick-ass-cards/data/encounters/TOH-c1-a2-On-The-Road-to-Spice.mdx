‚ùóTODO title image
![](/TOH/locations/hlohovec-throne-room.jpg)

üí° This act introduces combat rules, shows players problems of the ≈†pice region and introduces the bandits.

_Your noble family ventures forth from the grandeur of the capital in a long train of horses, carriages, and supplies towards the borderlands. You ride on horseback at the front and a couple of armed guards protect the caravan from the rear. As they travel further from the shining city, the road becomes less traveled and less maintained as nature starts to grow over it._  
_The few travellers you meet mostly keep to themselves not accustomed to noble men visiting to their region. You notice a few abandoned carts and even a couple piles of bones lying by the side of the road here and there._

_You are nearing a fork in the road, one arm coming from a small village on your right, the other continuing on through a forest towards the castle. You hear a ruccus and neighing from behind a nearby hill when a horse cart emerges from behind it. Something spooked the horses and they are running uncontrolled towards the fork. Cart is jumping on the rocks behind them with two characters trying to get hold of the reigns._  
_The cart takes a sharp turn right on the fork throwing one of the characters against a tree and into the bushes. The cart with the other person is speeding away from you. You see the royal symbol on the back of the cart and hear clinking of coins falling into the dust on the road._

**üé≠ What do you do?**

-   If players decide to not chase the cart, the cart will be lost. The tracks lead to the castle.
-   üîé The cart belongs to a tax collector **Bohdan Vlk** that was just thrown off it and is unconscious.
    -   He will be unconscious for some time, then he wakes up.
    -   He will explain the tax collector's wagon was ambushed by bandits with the help of a bandit disguised as a replacement guard. He took the cart, Bohdan fought back but he fell off the wagon.
    -   Appearance: Bogdan is a tall, lean man in his 40s with sharp features and black hair graying at the temples. He dresses in a long dark blue kaftan coat over a simple linen shirt and black trousers.  
    He carries a large coin purse and writing implements at his belt for recording payments. He is dirty and bloodied with a large bruise on his head from the fall.
    -   Character: He is very direct, serious and meticulous man especially when it comes to finances. He does not suffer fools or delays in financial matters lightly. Those who try cheating the tax system earn his swift anger.
    -   Motivation: He takes pride in being good at his job and providing well for his family.
-   üîé The other person is a local bandit leader **Ota ze Skoryce** disguised as a collector's guard **Otakar ze ≈†pice**.

### Chasing the Cart

_You spur your tired horses and start after the uncontrollable cart. They whine and snort loudly, but you pick up speed and leave the rest of your convoy behind in a cloud of dust. Your horses are tired after a long trip, but they can keep up for a while._

**üé≠ The cart is getting away, how do you want to catch it?**

        reward="Catch the cart"
    />
</List>

### Cought the cart

**üé≠ Describe how did you managed to make the cart stop**

-   üîé Ota ze Skoryce disguised as a tax collector guard will pretend to be grateful for the nobles intervention.
    -   He will make excuses to leave
    -   If the nobles won't let him go, he will ask them to accompany him to a nearby inn, where he wants wait for reinforcements. That is a lie. He will lead them to an ambush.
    -   He might even make a run for it.

### Ambush

_You see tracks leading off from the main road into the forest. You follow the tracks into a small mossy clearing under a big oak where they disappear.  
You looked around and suddenly the mossy ground opens up and a group of bandits spring out of their hiding. They wait for nothing and strike while you are surprised._

### üí° This is a battle encounter

-   Deal out an enemy Actor card in front of each player.
-   You can deal some of the cards face down and reveal them only before the player's turn.
-   Draw 2 + 1 card for each enemy from the Threat deck
-   Any time before each player's turn, place a Threat card from your hand next to the enemy Actor to show what are they planning to do.
-   Players take turns clockwise or in any order they choose.
-   On their turn, player can move 1 zone and perform one action in any order.
-   The action can be an attack, interacting with some object, driving a vehicle, investigating and so on.
-   To see how their actions are effective, they need to play an Outcome card. The amount of Effect the Outcome card has tells how successful the action was.
-   For example:
    -   Player attacks a bandit with a sword
    -   Player plays a Success Outcome card with 2 Effect.
    -   This reduces the bandit's Toughness by 2.
-   When the player's turn ends, the Actors in front of the player take their turn.
-   They act according to their Threat card.
-   The players can defend from this attack by playing an Outcome card. This reduces the damage or blocks it completely.
-   For each unblocked Effect of attack the player receives an Injury.
-   At the end of the player's turn they draw up to 2 Outcome cards from their deck to a maximum of 3.
-   Players can defend other players by playing their Outcome card in their turn. This means they will have less cards on their own turn.
