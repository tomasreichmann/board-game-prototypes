# {title}

*The Empire burns and the Void hungers for what is left.*

*Once, the Solarian Empire ruled a thousand suns under the undying light of the Absolute Sovereign. Now, the Emperor’s voice has gone silent, his heirs wage proxy wars in the dark, and the Void itself hums with rebellion. The Solar Legion burns worlds in the name of order, the Technocratic League replaces faith with circuitry, and the Hemomancers twist flesh into new gods.  
But amid the floating wrecks and dying stars, your crew dares to fly…*

*A handful of outcasts, scavengers, and visionaries aboard a half-broken ship—fighting off raiders, patching ruptured hulls, rerouting power mid-battle, and diving into derelict stations that promise either death or unthinkable treasure. Against collapsing fleets and cosmic horrors, you’ll chart your own path through a dying galaxy.*

*What are you waiting for? Seal the hull breach and go charge the lasers!*
