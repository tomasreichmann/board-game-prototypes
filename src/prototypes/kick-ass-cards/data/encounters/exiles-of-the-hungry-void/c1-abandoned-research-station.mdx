# An Abandoned Research Station

💡 {prompt}

_You cut off engines as a dark silhouette of an Imperial research station comes into view. Unmarked, cold and motionless in the void. No running lights, no comm broadcast, or docking traffic. Just a dead structure drifting in space. Could there still be something of value?_

-   The station seems abandoned.
-   🎭 You can all go inside, or have someone stay on the sensors.
-   🔎 **Sensors:**
    -   Effect 1: There are no life signs inside the station. The only thing you can find are some Tools.
    -   Effect 2: There is still power in some sections of the station. You pinpointed a generator room that has an upgrade module compatible with your ship's generator.
    -   Effect 3: You noticed the security system is still online, but inactive.

-   You arrived at the station in your shuttle and decided to split to cover more ground:

🎭 Where do you want to go? There are several sections: Canteen, Armory, Garden, Lab
    -   🔎 **Canteen:** You raided their pantry to find all most of the food supplies have rotten.  
    🏺 Except for a couple packs of **highly addictive Wasabi nuts** (2x Comfort).
    -   🔎 **Armory:** The security system immediately activates when you enter and sprays you with laser fire.  
        -   Defend from a 3 Effect attack.
            -   You take (3 - Effect) Injury.
            -   Fumble: You retreat.
            -   Otherwise: 🏺 You find a **Light Armor** and a **Fire suppressing grenade** (Insulating Thrown Weapon)
    -   🔎 **Garden:** You take a stroll though a slightly overgrown garden. Various herbs and vegetables grow around glass dome and slowly claim the surrounding walls and paths. The star-light coming through the canopy of leaves glows beautifully. It's nice to be reminded of how nature finds a way to survive and thrive even without humans. Remove any **Distress** if you have any. Or take a **Boost**.
    -   🔎 **Lab:** It seems like the lab was evacuated in a hurry. Some chemical leaked from a container. There are several corpses next to it. How did you do searching the lab?
        -   **Fumble**: there must have been something toxic still in the air. You got a terrible headache (1x **Distress**) and left before it got worse.
        -   **Otherwise**: 🏺 You find materials for making a prototype **regenerator** There is enough to make (Effect times) **Empowered Healing**.
    -   🔎 **Crew quarters:** The room is a mess. A bloody message on the wall reads: *"It is coming. And it is HUNGRY!"*. There are some broken unopened beer bottles on the table.
        -   🏺 You found a **dirty magazine** (Comfort) under the bed.
        -   **Fumble**: You are shaken by the horrible sight (1x **Distress**) and decided to leave.
        -   **Otherwise**: 🏺 You find a bloody **hunting knife** (Light Weapon).

📅 You meet back at the docking bay and return back to your ship, leaving the abandoned station behind a little emptier.
