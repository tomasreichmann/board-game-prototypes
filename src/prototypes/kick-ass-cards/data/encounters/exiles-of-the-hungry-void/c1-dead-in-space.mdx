# Dead in space

_Your ship drifts alongside a derelict smuggler vessel, barely held in place by the last sputtering traces of its stabilizers. Below it, the gas giant churns in silent fury — a titanic storm of amber clouds and crushing pressure. The smuggler ship is sliding toward that maelstrom, slow but inevitable, its broken engines glowing faintly like dying embers._

_A cracked transmission flickers through your comms.  
A voice — strained, whispering, almost fearful — cuts through the static._

_“We… need assistance. Our ship has been compromised. Our engines are dead. We have no defenses. Please… help us before gravity finishes what our enemies began. Tools to repair our generator or emergency battery would suffice.”_

_A pause. You hear movement behind the speaker: chanting? metal scraping? The comm flickers again._

_“We cannot pay. Not in any conventional sense. But we can offer… a gift. One we are forbidden to describe or send ahead. Bound by contract with our souls.”_

_The transmission ends abruptly._

-   💡 This encounter is about meaningful decisions that have impact.

-   Sensors: 
    -   Ship's engines are out of order.
    -   It is a matter of time till it falls into the gas giant and everything will be crushed by it's pressure.
    -   **0 Effect:** 🔎 The ship does not have any defense.
    -   **1 Effect:** 🔎 It used to be a smuggler's ship, but you identify the crew as Hadeans, cultists obsessed with death.
    -   **2 Effect:** 🔎 There is something loaded into an escape pod. But there are no life signs.
    -   **3 Effect:** 🔎 You are pretty sure the gift is a book.

-   🎭 It is up to you to decide their fate
    -   Wait till they fall into the gas giant
        -   🔎 The ship and everything on board is unceremoniously crushed by the immense pressure of the gas giant core.
    -   Attack them
        -   🔎 You attack the ship and a chain reaction causes the generator to explode, destroying the ship and killing the crew instantly.
        -   🏺 You salvage a surprising amount of bones. You might be able to sell them as **scrap (3x Resources)**.
    -   Send Tools or Emergency Battery via an escape pod
        -   🔎 The ship trades and escape pod with you. Upon opening, you find a book of dark sorcery. It describes a Ritual of raising dead. Allowing you to animate a body of a dead humanoid and control it for as long as you focus at the distance of several kilometers (enough to reach an enemy spaceship even). You need to spend some downtime studying the tome before you can use the ritual.

_You leave the gas giant behind and jump away._
