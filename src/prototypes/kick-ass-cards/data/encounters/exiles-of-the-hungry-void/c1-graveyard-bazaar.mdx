# Graveyard Bazaar

-   💡 This encounter should be the end of the first chapter. A change of pace and an opportunity to buy upgrades and equipment, work on long term projects, and reflect on the past adventure.

_Neon symbols flare against the stitched-together hulls, lighting the maze of wrecked ships that form the Graveyard Bazaar. Smugglers, scavengers, cultists, and wanderers drift between makeshift stalls and glowing stages, their shadows broken by the pulse of cheap generators and drifting lantern drones._

_Above, the electrified scrap-world crackles with blue lightning, illuminating the silent orbit of shattered cruisers and alien husks. Plasma welders spark in the dark as crews repair battered vessels, music vibrates the rusty floor on which you stand from nearby cargo stages, and traders shout over each other over intercom in half a dozen dialects._

_For one night, the graveyard lives — a neon carnival built atop a site of ancient battle._

-   There are plenty of things to do here:
    -   Buy upgrades for your ship
    -   Buy and sell equipment
    -   Work on your projects
    -   Ask around for help or advice

-   There will be a big concert later. You see people rushing to finish work so they can make it.

-   🎭 How do you want to spend your time here?

## Buy upgrades for your ship

📅 Brood mother is dead:  
The remaining critters scattered into the deep tunnels. It doesn't look like they will bother the automatons any more. When you get back to the docking bay a shipment of precious metals is waiting for you packed by the bay door.

_You leave the outpost and prepare to jump away._
