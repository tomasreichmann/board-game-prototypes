# Mining Colony Has a Pest Problem

-   💡 This encounter should be an introduction to combat. An easy fight with many weak enemies.

_The docking clamps seize your ship with a metallic shudder, drawing you into a tiny mining outpost half-buried in the crust of a lonely dwarf planet. A projection flickers to life: a mining foreman automaton, voice flat but urgent:  
“Wildlife detected in extraction tunnels. Hostile behavior escalating. Colony protocols forbid harm to native species. Outsourcing resolution. Payment available in refined metals.”_

_The airlock hisses open revealing a dark corridor with flickering red lights at the end and wires hanging from the ceiling. The air inside tastes sterile, recycled too many times. Several robots shuffle through the corridor — their chassis dented, scratched, and smeared with mineral dust. A few bear fresh gouges, as if something small but determined has been testing their plating. One robot is lying on the floor, its body torn to shreds, leaking black oil forming a dark puddle around it._

-   The mining automatons keep to themselves, ignoring the crew, busy with their work.
-   You hear skittering noises and see fleeting shadows. It seems the critters are avoiding you for now.
-   🕐 **Counter: Finding the nest (1 per player):**  
    -   🎭 There must be a nest somewhere. How do you want to find it?
    -   💡 Resolve the counter after one round. For each missing point in the counter, the critters get a jump on the players and a free attack.

## The nest

_The tunnel widens into a jagged chamber coated in a waxy residue. A faint, living hum fills the air. Shredded insulation, torn wiring, and bits of metal have been piled into crude nests circling a shallow central pit.  
Something shifts inside each mound — tiny bodies beneath scavenged debris. Dozens of glinting eyes follow your lights, the floor around them scraped with countless claw marks.  
One critter darts forward. Cat-sized, lean and armored in patches of chitin, it crouches on hooked climbing claws. Its glossy black eyes fix on you, sensory spines quivering as it bares needle teeth in a clicking snarl far too loud for its size.  
Then more shapes spill from the nests, leaping toward you all at once._

### Tunnel critter battle

💡 There are twice as many Tunnel critters as players. At the start of the 3rd round the tunnels shake and the Tunnel critter brood mother appears. The critters will defend her with her life, if she dies, they scatter.

📅 At the start of 3rd round, the tunnel shake.
-   All players defend from falling rocks (1 Injury)
-   The Tunnel critter brood mother appears.

## 📅 Brood mother is dead

-   The remaining critters scattered into the deep tunnels. It doesn't look like they will bother the automatons any more. 
-   🏺 When you get back to the docking bay a **shipment of precious metals** (worth 5x Resources) is waiting for you packed by the bay door.

_You leave the outpost and prepare to jump away._
