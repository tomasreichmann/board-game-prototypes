# Graveyard Bazaar

💡 {prompt}

_Neon symbols flare against the stitched-together hulls, lighting the maze of wrecked ships that form the Graveyard Bazaar. Smugglers, scavengers, cultists, and wanderers drift between makeshift stalls and glowing stages, their shadows broken by the pulse of cheap generators and drifting lantern drones._

_Above, the electrified scrap-world crackles with blue lightning, illuminating the silent orbit of shattered cruisers and alien husks. Plasma welders spark in the dark as crews repair battered vessels, music vibrates the rusty floor on which you stand from nearby cargo stages, and traders shout over each other over intercom in half a dozen dialects._

_For one night, the graveyard lives — a neon carnival built atop a site of ancient battle. As you dock, a sense of safety washes over you. You finally release a breath that you didn't realize you were holding._

-   There are plenty of things to do here:
    -   Hire someone to break into the sealed corridor on your ship
    -   Buy upgrades for your ship
    -   Buy and sell equipment
    -   Work on your projects
    -   Ask around for help or advice
    -   Look around

-   There will be a big concert later. You see people rushing to finish work so they can make it.

-   🎭 **How do you want to spend your time here?**

## Break into the sealed Corridor

-   You can hire a crew to break into the sealed corridor on your ship for **3x Resource**
-   🔎 You discovered the corridor was infested with cockroaches which quickly spread throughout your ship.
    -   🎭 **How do you want to deal with them before they eat any unattended Rations you have?**

🏺 You discovered 3 empty rooms on your ship and a mysterious artefact.
    -   🔎 It does not seem human made. There are some strange symbols on it, but you have no idea where to start in translating it.
    -   🔎 It seems to be somehow stuck to the ground, you are unable to move it.
    -   🔎 There doesn't appear to be a way to get inside.
    -   🔎 Nobody at the Bazaar wants to have anything to do with this. They say it looks like it will bring them bad luck.

## Ask around for help or advice

You can find experts to help you with your current projects or to teach you new skills in exchange for some Resources.

🔎 If you look for Void technology or information about the Void Horror, you find a group of Void cultists that provide protection for the bazaar. They carry some kind of alien relic that should create an invisible protective bubble that prevents sub-space tearing. The cultists are very protective of their technology and will not let you near it, nor will they discuss it. If threatened, they teleport with the relic away.

## Look around

_You walk around but don't really pay attention to the merchandise. Instead, you notice the rugged beauty of the makeshift bazaar put together from pieces of ancient ships, neon signs and discarded technology, that is used as decoration - it's original purpose long forgotten. You breathe it in, the smell of ozone and burnt metal, and the faint, sweet scent of alien spices. You feel a strange sense of peace here, despite the chaos. You could stay here for a while, just watching the crowds. You met a couple people that seem to also enjoy the atmosphere._

### Concert

_As dusk settles over the scrap-world, the Graveyard Bazaar transforms. Stalls are being disassembled and the low hum of commerce is replaced by the thumping bass of music. Stages, fashioned from salvaged cargo containers, come alive with holographic projections and strobing lights. A cacophony of music fills the void—from the guttural chants of a death-cult choir to the high-energy synth-rock of augmented ex-soldiers, and the hypnotic, dissonant melodies of a Void-seer's solo performance. Crowds of smugglers, mechanics, and wanderers dance on makeshift floors, their faces lit by neon and the occasional pyrotechnic burst. The air is thick with the smell of cheap synth-ale, exotic foods, and the electric charge of a festival in full swing._

-   All your Distress is removed.

🎭 **You finally have time to unwind and reflect on your journey. What are you thinking about?**

### Party's over

_As the last band took their bow, the crowd slowly dispersed, leaving behind a scattering of empty bottles and a lingering scent of ozone and synth-ale. The docked ships are leaving one by one and the sense of unease returns. You decide to not dawdle and prepare to leave._

-   🔎 If you check on the Void Seers, they are gone.
