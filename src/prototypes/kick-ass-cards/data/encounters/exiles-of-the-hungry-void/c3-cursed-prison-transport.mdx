![Cinematic digital painting — a massive Imperial prison transport ship, torn apart in deep space, drifting in a vast field of shattered hull plates, bent girders, and swirling debris. The vessel’s once-monolithic frame now hangs open like a carcass, its armored spine split and twisted. From within the ruptured core, unholy green energy crackles and pulses, crawling along the broken superstructure like unnatural lightning. Faint glyph-like patterns flicker inside the glow — hints of something awakened or unleashed. Chunks of plating float weightlessly, rotating in slow arcs through the void. A few intact prison cells drift freely, their walls scorched, doors blown open. Below the ruined bays, escape pods fire sporadically, launching in erratic bursts of motion — some with controlled ignition burns, others tumbling wildly as they streak away from the dying ship. Their engine flares cut sharp neon lines across the darkness. Lighting: eerie green bioluminescent pulses from the ship’s exposed core; cold starlight catching metallic debris; distant warm glints from fleeing escape pods. Palette: sickly green, cold steel gray, deep void black, faint reactor amber, and muted Imperial whites. Textures: torn alloy, cracked bulkheads, drifting dust clouds, scorched plating, leaking energy arcs. Mood: catastrophic rupture — a moment suspended between destruction and desperate flight. Composition: 3:2 wide shot with the shattered prison ship dominating the frame, debris drifting in layered depth, escape pods streaking away into the void, and green energy illuminating the scene from within the wreck.](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/scenes/cursed_prison_transport.png)

# Cursed Prison Transport

💡 {prompt}

_Following a distress call, you arrive at a debris field where the Imperial prison transport, *The Penitent's Sorrow*, lies in ruins. Its hull is torn open, and an unsettling green energy pulses from within. As you watch, escape pods launch from the wreck, scattering into the void._
