campaign: Exiles of the Hungry Void
chapter: 3
title: Missile Stockpile Raid
hook: You detected a concentration of materials normally used for missile production at a nearby asteroid field.
prompt: This encounter is a quick one-round threat → resolution encounter. A missile battery launches 2x player count of different rockets immediately when the space-ship jumps in. Players can each try to destroy/hack/evade the rockets. Each missile that is not dealt with strikes a random system on the ship. The types of rockets are Incendiary, Breach, EMP, Toxic.

![Cinematic digital painting — a sudden ambush in deep space as a disguised asteroid unfolds into a hidden weapons platform. A spacecraft just out of frame has jumped into the sector, illuminating a field of drifting debris and jagged rock fragments with its arrival flash. One nearby asteroid—previously indistinguishable from inert stone—shifts unnaturally. Its cracked surface slides open along mechanical seams, revealing an automated missile battery nested inside like the exposed heart of a machine predator. Servo-arms adjust with predatory precision. Missile ports glow with different hues as the platform locks onto its target in milliseconds. A violent volley launches at once: Incendiary missile trailing a spiraling plume of molten-orange fire, Breach missile with a sharp cobalt contrail and armored tip, EMP torpedo shedding crackling blue-white arcs of ionized static, Toxic warhead venting sickly green vapor as it streaks through the dark. The hostile barrage crosses the frame before any defensive systems can rise, lighting the cold void with chaotic, multicolored streaks. Fragments of dust and micro-debris are illuminated in the crossfire, shimmering like frozen sparks. Lighting: sharp contrast from missile ignition flares; cold starlight on the asteroid’s rough exterior; subtle backlighting from the off-screen ship’s arrival flash. Palette: cobalt blue, molten orange, toxic green, faded gray stone, and cold metal. Textures: jagged rock, hidden alloy plating, hydraulic seams, drifting dust clouds, engine vapor trails. Mood: sudden betrayal — the calm of space shattered by a trap sprung too fast to evade. Composition: 3:2 wide shot focused on the asteroid’s opening structure and the missile volley streaking toward the viewer; off-screen ship implied by backlighting and directional motion.](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/scenes/missile_stockpile_raid.png)

# Missile Stockpile

💡 {prompt}

_The stars wrench themselves back into familiar points of light as you exit the jump. Before the ship even settles, proximity alarms scream to life. A nearby asteroid, disguised as inert rock, slides open to reveal an automated missile battery. It fires a volley of missiles. **"Incoming! Multiple warheads!"** says the ship's machine spirit dryly._

_A number of different missiles (equal to **twice the number of crew members**) streaks toward your ship. They are a mixed bag of different technology and payloads different payload, a different flavor of disaster._

-   **Incendiary Missile:** Upon impact, starts a raging **Fire** in a random room it struck. Anyone in that room suffers **1 Burning** every turn until repaired.
-   **Breach Missile:** Causes a hull breach and vents the air from the room. Anyone in that room suffers **1 Freezing** every turn until repaired.
-   **EMP Missile:** Disables a random system, making it **Inoperable** for a round making the energy wasted.
-   **Toxic Missile:** Detonates a chemical payload, filling a random room with toxic gas. Anyone in that room takes **1 Distress** every turn until vented.

### Brace for Impact!

_You have seconds to act. Each crew member can try to intercept some missiles._

🎭 **How do you want to deal with the missiles?**

-   **Destroy it:** Target a missile with the ship's weapons. Each Effect destroys one missile.
-   **Hack it:** Splice into the missile's guidance system, turning it into a dud or making it veer off course.
    -   **Success:** You gain control of the missile.
    -   **Partial success:** The missile drifts harmlessly into space. 
    -   **Failure:** On a failure, the counter-intrusion locks you out.
-   **Evade it:** Each effect allows you to evade one missile.

### Resolution

_The next few seconds are a blur of frantic activity, explosions, and near misses._

-   For each **Effect**, one missile is neutralized.
-   The rest of the missiles strike your ship.
    -   💡 For each missile that hits, roll a D4 to find out what type it is. Then roll a die to determine which system is struck. Apply the missile's effect._

_As quickly as it began, the assault is over. the echoes of explosions still ringing in your ears and the smell of ozone and smoke filling the corridors._

-   The automated battery, having expended its loaded missiles, retracts back into the asteroid.
-   You find a door on the other side of the asteroid, where a supply of missile parts are stored. There is a data-shard with missile schematics, but the machine spirit seems to only want to part with a single missile before it destroys the data-shard.  
🏺 Which missile design do you want to keep?
    -   **Incendiary Missile**
    -   **Breach Missile**
    -   **EMP Missile**
    -   **Toxic Missile**
