![Cinematic digital painting — a chaotic space battle raging around a massive, repurposed industrial space station in the middle of a dust nebula, currently used as a smuggler' base, "Rock Bottom". Renesance style, ships of the Machine church, glowing with righteous blue energy, bombard the station with pulse lasers. A few smaller, scrappy smuggler vessels support station's defensive turrets, returning fire. Explosions blossom silently against the station's pockmarked surface and the shields of the machine church fleet. The station itself is a sprawling complex of gantries, docking bays, and makeshift structures built on top of original bulky factories. Emergency lights flash around the station. Lighting: harsh, strobing flashes from weapons fire and explosions, casting sharp shadows across the asteroid and ships. The cold, distant starlight provides a dim ambient light. Palette: cold blues and whites of the machine church ships' energy, fiery oranges of explosions, and the dull gray of dusty nebula, punctuated by the varied colors of the smuggler ships. Textures: scorched metal plates of the station, decorated metallic hulls of the machine church ships, weathered patchwork plating of the smuggler vessels. Mood: a desperate siege, chaotic and intense. Composition: 3:2 wide shot, capturing the scale of the battle with the industrial station as the central focus, ships engaged in combat around it.](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/scenes/siege_of_rock_bottom.png)

# Siege of Rock Bottom

💡 {prompt}

_You jump into a system ablaze with conflict. Your sensors are flooded with comms chatter and weapons fire. A flotilla of decorated Machinist priest vessels is laying siege to a massive industrial station, "Rock Bottom." Bright pulses of laser score the station's rusty plating, while scrappy smuggler ships and automated turrets return fire._

_A priority channel cuts through the noise: **"This is the vessel *Cog's Righteous Fury*. The heretics of Rock Bottom harbor a stolen Machinist relic. Surrender it, and we will cease this purification. Resist, and be cleansed by holy fire."** Another voice, laced with static and defiance, retorts: **"We don't have your shitty trinket, you zealots! Piss off before we make your ships see-through!"**_

_The battle rages, and your unexpected arrival has not gone unnoticed. Both sides are hailing you, demanding you declare your allegiance or be treated as hostile. This is a chance to make powerful allies, or a great deal of profit._
