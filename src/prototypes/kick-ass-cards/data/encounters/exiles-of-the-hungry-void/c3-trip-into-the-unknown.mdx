campaign: Exiles of the Hungry Void
chapter: 3
title: Trip into the Unknown
hook: Unsettling gravity waves from a nearby nebula match the void entity's signature.
prompt: This encounter is a "push your luck" scenario where players explore a dangerous nebula. Each level deeper offers greater rewards and intel about the void entity, but at increasing risk. Players must succeed at Piloting or Engineering checks to proceed, with failure causing ship damage.

![Cinematic digital painting — a small, rugged exploration ship navigating a treacherous nebula. The ship is dwarfed by colossal, swirling clouds of incandescent gas and dark, cosmic dust. The nebula is a chaotic tapestry of vibrant colors: deep purples, electric blues, and fiery oranges, all interwoven with veins of blackness. Gravity lenses warp the starlight behind the clouds, creating distorted, dreamlike patterns. The ship’s engines leave a faint trail as it carefully maneuvers through a canyon of glowing gas. Tendrils of energy, like ethereal lightning, arc between the nebula’s dense pockets, occasionally lashing out into the void. The ship’s hull plating shows signs of wear and recent scorching, suggesting a perilous journey. Lighting: dramatic and high-contrast, with the ship illuminated by the nebula’s internal glow. Sharp shadows are cast across its hull. The surrounding space is filled with a soft, ambient light from the swirling gases. Palette: rich and saturated jewel tones—amethyst, sapphire, and amber—contrasted with deep, inky blacks. Textures: smooth, gaseous clouds; sharp, crystalline dust particles; weathered and scored metal on the ship. Mood: awe-inspiring but dangerous; a sense of venturing into a beautiful yet hostile frontier. Composition: 3:2 wide shot, with the ship positioned off-center to emphasize the immense scale and chaotic beauty of the nebula.](/mighty-decks/encounters/exiles_of_the_hungry_void/scenes/trip_into_the_unknown.png)

# Trip into the Unknown

💡 {prompt}

_Your sensors pick up familiar, unsettling gravity waves emanating from a nearby nebula. The patterns are eerily similar to those of the void entity. This could be a chance to gather vital intelligence on the creature._

_The nebula is a swirling chaos of gas, dust, and gravitational anomalies. Each foray deeper into its core will allow you to get better readings but also exposes your ship to increasing danger. _

💡 Every time players decide to go deeper, they need to explain how are they helping to overcome the current challenge.  
The challenge rating starts at player count and rises by half the amount of players rounded down for each level.
If the total Effect equals or exceeds the current challenge the spaceship moves without incident.  
If the check does not meet the challenge, a random ship-system is damaged for each missing Effect.

-   **Success:** The crew navigates the treacherous currents and uncover something of value.
-   **Failure:** The ship is battered by the nebula. It takes **1 Damage** to a random system for each point of **Effect** the crew failed the check by.

## Enter the Maelstrom

_The nebula's edge crackles with volatile energy. Jagged arcs of lightning, thick as a transport freighter, lash out unpredictably. Navigating this celestial storm requires precision and a bit of luck. One wrong move could leave you dead in the water—or worse._

💡 The electrical discharges at the edge of the nebula are constantly changing and difficult to navigate through. A hit by a single discharge damages the hit system and takes it offline for the next challenge. Anyone nearby suffers Distress.

🎭 **How are you helping your crew to get through this?**

-   You record readings of the sub space anomaly and from now on you can detect if the void entity is about to appear with certainty.

## Science logs

💡 The ship moves deeper and encounters clouds of burning plasma. Between them a destroyed science vessel drifts, its hull scarred and breached. Everything of value from the shipwreck was fried to dust by the extreme heat. But data storage devices are often protected and at least partially could be recovered. There is a high chance you can get something of value from this.

_..._

💡 The plasma clouds threaten any attempt at reaching the shipwreck. Getting too close to one can cause fires to erupt on your ship and raise the temperature on the whole ship. A fire erupts in a random system room and everyone on the ship receives **Burning**.

🎭 **How are you going to help recover the logs?**
